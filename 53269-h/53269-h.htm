<p>It was only a dream. Eddie Taylor would like
to have finished it, but the bar of morning sunlight
poking in under the window shade pried
his eyes open. The dream fled. Eddie kicked
off the sheet, swung his feet to the floor, and
groped under the bed for his tennis shoes.</p>
<p>He heard his father&rsquo;s heavy footsteps in the
hallway. They stopped outside of his bedroom
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You awake, Eddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake, Dad,&rdquo; Eddie answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast&rsquo;s ready. Get washed and
dressed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be right there,&rdquo; Eddie said. Then, remembering
the dream, he added, &ldquo;Oh, Dad, is it
all right if I use the Geiger counter today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor opened the door. He was a big
man, broad-shouldered and still thin-waisted.
Eddie found it easy to believe the stories he
had heard about his father being an outstanding
football player in his time. Even his glasses
and the gray hair at his temples didn&rsquo;t add
much age, although Eddie knew it had been
eighteen years since his father had played his
last game of college football.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may use the Geiger counter any time
you want, Eddie,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said, &ldquo;as long as
you take good care of it. You figured out where
you can find some uranium ore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie smiled sheepishly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I had a
dream,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Plain as day. It was out on
Cedar Point. I was walking along over some
rocks. Suddenly the Geiger counter began
clicking like everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cedar Point?&rdquo; his father asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never been out there. But, from what I hear,
there are plenty of rock formations. Might
be worth a try, at that. You never can tell
where you might strike some radioactivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in dreams, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, that&rsquo;s a tough question, son.
I can&rsquo;t say that I really do. Still, one clue is
as good as another when it comes to hunting
uranium ore, I guess. But right now we&rsquo;d
better get out to breakfast before your mother
scalps us. Hurry it up.&rdquo; His father turned
and went back down the hallway toward the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Eddie pulled on his trousers and T shirt
and went into the bathroom. He washed hurriedly,
knowing that even if he missed a spot
or two, he was fairly safe. During the summer
months his freckles got so thick and dark that
it would take a magnifying glass to detect any
small smudges of dirt hiding among them. He
plastered some water on his dark-red hair,
pushed a comb through it, and shrugged as it
snapped back almost to its original position.
Oh, well, he had tried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>He grinned into the mirror, reached a
finger into his mouth, and unhooked the
small rubber bands from his tooth braces.
He dropped them into the waste basket. He&rsquo;d
put fresh ones in after breakfast.</p>
<p>He brushed his teeth carefully, taking particular
pains around the metal braces. The
tooth-straightening orthodontist had warned
him about letting food gather around the
metal clamps. It could start cavities.</p>
<p>Finished, Eddie went out to breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, dear,&rdquo; his mother greeted
him, handing him a plate of eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mom,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Gotta hurry. Big
day today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So your father says. But I&rsquo;m afraid your
big day will have to start with sorting out and
tying up those newspapers and magazines that
have been collecting in the garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Mom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie, I asked you to do it three days ago.
Remember? And the Goodwill truck comes
around today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;No arguments, son,&rdquo; his father put in
calmly but firmly. &ldquo;School vacation doesn&rsquo;t
mean that your chores around here are on
vacation, too. Get at it right away, and you&rsquo;ll
still have time to hunt your uranium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor added, excusing himself
from the table, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be getting over
to school. I&rsquo;m expecting to receive shipment
of a new radioisotope today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very word excited Eddie. In fact, anything
having to do with atomic science
excited him. He knew something about
isotopes&mdash;pronounced <i>eye-suh-tope</i>. You
couldn&rsquo;t have a father who was head of the
atomic-science department at Oceanview
College without picking up a little knowledge
along the way. Eddie knew that a radioisotope
was a material which had been &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; in an
atomic reactor until it was &ldquo;hot&rdquo; with radioactivity.
When carefully controlled, the radiation
stored up in such isotopes was used in
many beneficial ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t college professors get summer
vacations, too?&rdquo; Eddie asked. One reason for
asking that particular question was to keep
from prying deeper into the subject of the
radioisotope. Much of his father&rsquo;s work at
Oceanview College was of a secret nature.
Eddie had learned not to ask questions about
it. His father usually volunteered any information
he wanted known, so Eddie stuck to
questions which could and would be answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get vacations,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;But&mdash;well,
my work is a little different, you know.
At the speed atomic science is moving today,
we simply can&rsquo;t afford to waste time. But don&rsquo;t
worry. We&rsquo;ll take a week or so off before school
starts in the fall. Maybe head for the mountains
with our tent and sleeping bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Geiger counter?&rdquo; Eddie asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t think of leaving it home,&rdquo; his
father said, smiling. &ldquo;By the way, I put new
batteries in it the other day. Take it easy on
them. Remember to switch it off when you&rsquo;re
not actually using it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Eddie promised. He had forgotten
several times before, weakening the batteries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>It took Eddie over an hour to sort out the
newspapers and magazines in the garage, tie
them in neat bundles, and place them out on
the front curb for the Goodwill pickup. By
that time the sun was high overhead. It had
driven off the coolness which the ocean air
had provided during the earlier hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else, Mom?&rdquo; he asked, returning
to the house and getting the Geiger counter
out of the closet. He edged toward the back
door before his mother had much time to
think of something more for him to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Taylor said, smiling
over his hasty retreat. &ldquo;What are you going
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll do a little prospecting,&rdquo; Eddie
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably in the hills beyond the college,&rdquo;
Eddie said. The more he thought about it, the
more he realized it was a little late in the day
to go to Cedar Point. The best way to get
there was by rowboat across Moon Bay, and
that was too long a row to be starting now.
Besides, there were plenty of other places
around the outskirts of Oceanview where
likely looking rock formations invited search
with a Geiger counter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going alone?&rdquo; his mother asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, guess I&rsquo;ll stop by and see if Teena
wants to go,&rdquo; Eddie answered casually. He
tried to make it sound as though he would
be doing Teena Ross a big favor. After all,
she was only a girl. Eddie didn&rsquo;t figure a girl
would make a very good uranium prospecting
partner, but most of the fellows he knew were
away at camp, or vacationing with their folks,
or something like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll enjoy it, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Sandy, too,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;He needs
the exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea, dear. Be back in time
for an early dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie let Sandy off his chain. The taffy-colored
cocker spaniel yipped wildly over his
freedom, racing back and forth as Eddie
started down the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>Christina Ross&mdash;whom everybody called
Teena&mdash;lived at the far end of the block.
Eddie went around to the side door of the
light-green stucco house and knocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hi, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena greeted him, appearing
at the screen door. &ldquo;I was hoping
you&rsquo;d come over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I just happened to be going by,&rdquo;
Eddie said. &ldquo;Thought you might want to
watch me do a little prospecting with the Geiger
counter. But maybe you&rsquo;re too busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how to handle it, Eddie thought.
Don&rsquo;t act anxious. Let Teena be anxious.
Then maybe she&rsquo;ll even offer to bring along
a couple of sandwiches or some fruit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to go,&rdquo; Teena said eagerly,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m just finishing the dishes. Come on
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in kind of a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only be a minute.&rdquo; She pushed the
screen door open for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make us some
sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here, Sandy,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Sit.&rdquo; The
dog minded, although he looked a bit rebellious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Eddie went inside and followed Teena to
the kitchen. He felt triumphant about the
sandwiches.</p>
<p>Teena tossed him a dish towel. &ldquo;You dry
them,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You&rsquo;re in a hurry, aren&rsquo;t you?
I can make the sandwiches while you dry the
silverware.&rdquo; She smiled, putting tiny crinkles
in her small, slightly upturned nose. She wore
her hair in a pony tail. Even though her hair
was blond all year long, it seemed even
lighter in the summer. Eddie couldn&rsquo;t tell
whether the sun had faded it, or whether her
deep summer tan simply made her hair look
lighter by contrast. Maybe both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said, coming into
the kitchen. &ldquo;Looks like Teena put you to
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She always does, Mrs. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie said,
pretending great injury. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know why I
keep coming over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Teena spoke up quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because we&rsquo;re friends, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Eddie knew she was right. They were
friends&mdash;good friends. They had been ever
since Eddie&rsquo;s family had moved to Oceanview
and his father had become head of the college&rsquo;s
atomic-science department. In fact, their
parents were close friends, also. Teena&rsquo;s father
was chief engineer for the Acme Aviation
Company, one of the coast town&rsquo;s largest
manufacturing concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be glad to finish them, Eddie,&rdquo;
Mrs. Ross offered. &ldquo;I know how boys detest
doing dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t really mind, Mrs. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie
said. &ldquo;Besides, Teena&rsquo;s making sandwiches to
take with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another prospecting trip?&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s
mother glanced at the Geiger counter which
Eddie had set carefully on the dinette table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still think there must be some uranium
around here,&rdquo; Eddie insisted. &ldquo;And we can
find it if anyone can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said. &ldquo;But even if you
don&rsquo;t find it, you both seem to enjoy your
hikes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it&rsquo;s fun, Mother,&rdquo; Teena replied,
wrapping wax paper around a sandwich.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;m ready. I&rsquo;ve got a bone for Sandy,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go too far out from town,&rdquo; Mrs.
Ross cautioned, as Eddie picked up the Geiger
counter. &ldquo;And stick near the main roads.
You know the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure do, Mrs. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie assured
her. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll be back early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked past the college campus, and
toward the rocky foothills beyond. At various
rock mounds and outcroppings, Eddie
switched on the Geiger counter. The needle
of the dial on the black box wavered slightly.
A slow clicking came through the earphones,
but Eddie knew these indicated no more than
a normal background count. There were slight
traces of radioactivity in almost all earth or
rocks. It was in the air itself, caused by mysterious
and ever-present cosmic rays, so there
was always a mild background count when
the Geiger counter was turned on; but to
mean anything, the needle had to jump far
ahead on the gauge, and the clicking through
the earphones had to speed up until it sounded
almost like bacon frying in a hot skillet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>There was none of that today. After they
had hiked and searched most of the forenoon,
Eddie said, &ldquo;We might as well call it a day,
Teena. Doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right with me,&rdquo; Teena agreed,
plucking foxtails from Sandy&rsquo;s ears. &ldquo;Pretty
hot, anyway. Let&rsquo;s eat our sandwiches and go
back home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;You know, one of
these days I&rsquo;d like to go out to Cedar Point
and scout around. Maybe we&rsquo;ll find something
there.&rdquo; Then he told Teena about his dream.</p>
<p>Teena smiled. &ldquo;A dream sure isn&rsquo;t much to
go on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they say it&rsquo;s pretty out on
Cedar Point. I&rsquo;ll go any time you want to,
Eddie.&rdquo; She handed him one of the sandwiches.</p>
<p>It was midafternoon by the time they arrived
back at Teena&rsquo;s house. They worked a while
on a new jigsaw puzzle Teena had received
on a recent birthday. Then Eddie said good-by
and went on down the street toward his
own home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>After putting Sandy on his long chain and
filling his water dish, Eddie went in the back
door. He put the Geiger counter in the closet
and went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner, Mom?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Taylor turned from the sink. Eddie
knew at once, just seeing the expression on
his mother&rsquo;s face, that something was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner?&rdquo; his mother said absently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not quite four o&rsquo;clock yet, Eddie. Besides,
dinner may be a little late today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this morning you said it would be
early,&rdquo; Eddie reminded her, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning I didn&rsquo;t know what might
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Then Eddie heard the sound of his father&rsquo;s
voice coming from the den. There was a
strange urgent tone in it. The door to the den
was open. Eddie went through the dining
room and glanced into the den. His father
sat stiffly behind his homemade desk, talking
rapidly into the telephone. Eddie caught only
the last few sketchy words. Then his father
placed the telephone in its cradle, glanced up,
and saw Eddie.</p>
<p>If there had been even the slightest doubt
in Eddie&rsquo;s mind about something being
wrong, it vanished now. Mr. Taylor looked
years older than he had that very morning.
Worry lay deep in his eyes. He fumbled
thoughtfully with a pencil, turning it end over
end on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, son,&rdquo; he said. He didn&rsquo;t even ask
whether Eddie had discovered any uranium
ore that day. Always before, he had shown
genuine interest in Eddie&rsquo;s prospecting trips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Eddie said anxiously, &ldquo;what&mdash;what&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shows that much, does it, son?&rdquo; his
father said tiredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Dad?&rdquo; Eddie prompted.
&ldquo;Or can&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor leaned back. &ldquo;Quite a bit&rsquo;s
wrong, Eddie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I guess there&rsquo;s
no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you. It&rsquo;ll be in
the evening papers, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Evening papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie, you remember me mentioning this
morning about that radioisotope shipment I
was expecting today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Did it come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; his father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean, Dad?&rdquo; Eddie asked,
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The delivery truck arrived at the school
with it,&rdquo; his father explained, &ldquo;but while the
driver was inquiring where to put it, the container
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappeared?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The radioisotope was stolen, Eddie,&rdquo; his
father said slowly. &ldquo;Stolen right out from
under our noses!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER TWO</h2>
<p>At the moment, Eddie didn&rsquo;t pry for further
information on the theft of the valuable radioactive
isotope. His father had plenty on his
mind, as it was. The main information was in
the evening <i>Globe</i>, which Eddie rushed out
to get as soon as he heard it plop onto the
front porch.</p>
<p>He took the newspaper to his father to read
first. After having finished, Mr. Taylor handed
the paper to Eddie and leaned back thoughtfully
in his chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got it pretty straight, at that,&rdquo; Mr.
Taylor said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid this is going to
stir up quite a bit of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault, was it, Dad?&rdquo; Eddie
defended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was as much mine as anybody&rsquo;s, son,&rdquo;
his father said. &ldquo;Probably more so. After all,
I am head of the department. I knew about
the shipment. That should make it my responsibility
to see that it was properly received
and placed in our atomic-materials storage
vault. But there is little point in trying to
place the blame on anyone. I&rsquo;m willing to accept
that part of it. The important thing is
that we recover that radioisotope. Not only is
it of a secret nature, but it is also dangerously
radioactive if improperly handled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but wasn&rsquo;t it in a safe container?&rdquo;
Eddie asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;There were
only two ounces of it in a fifty-pound lead
capsule. As long as it remains in that capsule
it&rsquo;s safe. As you know, the lead prevents any
radiation from escaping. Out of that capsule,
however, those two ounces of radioisotope can
be very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds,&rdquo; Eddie said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty big thing to steal, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when it&rsquo;s lead, son,&rdquo; his father replied.
&ldquo;Not much bigger than a two-quart
milk bottle, in fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even at that, no kid could have taken it,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid?&rdquo; His father smiled thinly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
think it was any kid, Eddie. Not by a long
shot. The whole thing was carefully planned
and carefully carried out. It was not the work
of amateurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie read the newspaper account. The
small truck from Drake Ridge, where one of
the country&rsquo;s newest atomic reactors was
located, had arrived earlier than expected at
Oceanview College. It had backed up to the
receiving dock where all of the college supplies
were delivered. Since deliveries during vacation
months were few, there was no one on the
dock when the truck arrived. A half hour later,
when the delivery was expected, there would
have been. The truck&rsquo;s early arrival had
caught them unprepared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The driver had left the truck and had gone
around the building to the front office. It had
taken him less than five minutes to locate the
receiving-dock foreman. Together, they had
returned through the small warehouse and
opened the rear door onto the dock.</p>
<p>During that short time someone had pried
open the heavy padlock on the delivery truck&rsquo;s
rear door and had stolen the fifty-pound lead
capsule containing the radioisotope.</p>
<p>Dusty footprints on the pavement around
the rear of the truck indicated that two men
had carried out the theft. A heavy iron pry bar
had been dropped at the rear of the truck after
the lock was sprung. It was a common type
used by carpenters. There were no fingerprints
or other identifying marks on it. The footprints
were barely visible and of no help other
than to indicate that two men were involved
in the crime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Eddie asked, looking up from the
paper, &ldquo;how could anyone carry away something
weighing fifty pounds without being noticed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chances are they had their car parked
nearby,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;As you know, there
are no fences or gates around Oceanview College.
People come and go as they please. As a
matter of fact, there are always quite a few
automobiles parked around the shipping and
receiving building, and parking space is scarce
even during summer sessions. Anyone could
park and wait there unnoticed. Or they could
walk around without attracting any undue attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad,&rdquo; Eddie continued, &ldquo;how would
the men know that the delivery truck would
arrive a half hour early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;They
may have had another plan. The way things
worked out, they didn&rsquo;t need to use it. The
early delivery and the business of leaving the
truck unguarded for a few minutes probably
gave them a better opportunity than they had
expected. At least, they took quick advantage
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what anyone would want with
a radioisotope,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Maybe they figured
there was something else inside of that
lead capsule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unlikely, son,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said.
&ldquo;Believe me, it was no common theft. Nor
were the thieves ordinary thieves. That isotope
was a new one. A very secret one. Our job at
the college was to conduct various tests with it
in order to find out exactly how it could best
be put to use as a cure for disease, or for sterilizing
food, or even as a source of power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Power?&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Boy, it must have
been a strong isotope.&rdquo; He knew that the
strength of radioisotopes could be controlled
largely by the length of time they were allowed
to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; in an atomic reactor and soak up
radioactivity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t planning to run a submarine
with it,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that strong.
Still, it doesn&rsquo;t take so very much radioactivity
to make two ounces of an isotope quite powerful&mdash;and
quite deadly. I only hope whoever
stole it knows what he&rsquo;s doing. However, I&rsquo;m
sure he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he must have been an atomic
scientist himself?&rdquo; Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just say he&mdash;or both of them&mdash;have
enough training in the subject to know how to
handle that isotope safely,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dad,&rdquo; Eddie wondered, &ldquo;what could
they do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could study it,&rdquo; his father explained.
&ldquo;At least, they could send it somewhere to be
broken down and studied. Being a new isotope,
the formula is of great value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, send it somewhere?&rdquo;
Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps to some other country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then you mean whoever stole it
were spies!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s entirely possible,&rdquo; his father said.
&ldquo;In fact, it&rsquo;s the only logical explanation I can
think of. People simply don&rsquo;t go around stealing
radioactive isotopes without a mighty important
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s mother called
from the kitchen.</p>
<p>During dinner Eddie wasn&rsquo;t sure just what
he was eating. The idea of spies stealing atomic
materials kept building up in his mind. By the
time dessert was finished, he was anxious to
talk with someone, yet he knew he shouldn&rsquo;t
bother his father with any more questions. He
asked if he could go over and visit with Teena
for a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were together most of the day,&rdquo;
his mother said, &ldquo;but I guess it&rsquo;s all right. Be
back in about an hour, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a balmy evening. On such evenings,
he and Teena sometimes walked along the
beach barefoot, collecting sea shells. Today
Eddie had no desire to do that. He ran down
the block.</p>
<p>Teena answered his knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on in, Eddie,&rdquo; she invited, seeming
surprised to see him. &ldquo;Mother and I are just
finishing dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I figured you&rsquo;d be through by now,&rdquo;
Eddie apologized, following her inside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said, but she
didn&rsquo;t seem as cheerful as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mrs. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
hope I&rsquo;m not making a pest of myself.&rdquo; He
looked around for Mr. Ross, but Teena&rsquo;s
father apparently hadn&rsquo;t arrived home from
Acme Aircraft yet. There wasn&rsquo;t a place set for
him at the table, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re never a pest, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross assured
him. &ldquo;I was going to call your mother in
a little while about that newspaper write-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you read it?&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could anyone miss it?&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;Right on the front page.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your father is quite concerned
over it,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Eddie affirmed. &ldquo;He was the one
who ordered the isotope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an isotope?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know, either,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
said. &ldquo;Maybe we could understand more of
what it&rsquo;s all about if you could explain what a
radioisotope is, Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Eddie said slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not easy to
explain, but I&rsquo;ll try. You know how rare
uranium is. There&rsquo;s not nearly enough of it to
fill all the needs for radioactive materials. Besides,
pure uranium is so powerful and expensive
and dangerous to handle that it&rsquo;s not
a very good idea to try using it in its true form.
So they build an atomic reactor like the one at
Drake Ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve driven by it,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said. &ldquo;My,
it&rsquo;s a big place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say,&rdquo; Eddie agreed. &ldquo;Of course, only
one building holds the reactor itself. It&rsquo;s the
biggest building near the center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember it,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the reactor is about four stories
high,&rdquo; Eddie went on. &ldquo;They call it a uranium
&lsquo;pile.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s made up of hundreds and hundreds
of graphite bricks. That&rsquo;s where they get the
name &lsquo;pile&rsquo;&mdash;from brick pile. Anyway, scattered
around in between the bricks are small
bits of uranium. Uranium atoms are radioactive.
That is, they keep splitting up and sending
out rays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they do that?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the way nature made uranium, I
guess,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Most atoms stay in one
piece, although they move around lickety-split
all of the time. Uranium atoms not only move
around, but they break apart. They shoot out
little particles called neutrons. These neutrons
hit other atoms and split them apart, sending
out more neutrons. It&rsquo;s a regular chain reaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of chain reactions,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, with all of the splitting up and moving
around of the uranium atoms,&rdquo; Eddie went
on, &ldquo;an awful lot of heat builds up. If they
don&rsquo;t control it&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ve seen pictures of
atomic-bomb explosions. That&rsquo;s a chain reaction
out of control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of control is right,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the atomic piles control the reaction,&rdquo;
Eddie said. &ldquo;The graphite bricks keep the
splitting-up atoms apart so one neutron won&rsquo;t
go smashing into other atoms unless they want
it to. They have ways of controlling it so that
only as much radiation builds up as they want.
You can even hear the reactor hum as the radioactive
rays go tearing through it. But by
careful tending, the scientists keep the atomic
collisions far enough apart so the thing doesn&rsquo;t
blow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that sounds dangerous,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they know just how to do it,&rdquo; Eddie
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t the rays dangerous?&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say they&rsquo;re dangerous,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;But the whole pile is covered by a shield of
concrete about eight feet thick. That keeps the
rays from getting out and injuring the workmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness. Eight feet is a lot of cement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot to stop radioactive atomic
particles,&rdquo; Eddie explained. &ldquo;Especially the
gamma rays. They&rsquo;re the fastest and most dangerous,
and the hardest to stop. Alpha and beta
rays are fairly easy to stop. But the gamma
rays are regular high-velocity invisible bullets.
They&rsquo;ll go right through a stone wall unless
it&rsquo;s plenty thick. Of course, you can&rsquo;t see them.
Not with even the most powerful microscope
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work around a place
where I might get shot at by&mdash;by dangerous
rays you can&rsquo;t even see,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Everyone is carefully
protected. They see to that. Well, anyway,
if all of those uranium atoms were shooting
radioactive rays around inside of that pile
and doing nothing, there would be an awful
lot of energy going to waste. So the atomic
scientists take certain elements which aren&rsquo;t
radioactive, but can be made radioactive, and
shove small pieces of them into holes drilled
in the pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that dangerous?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t shove them in with their bare
hands,&rdquo; Eddie said, trying not to show exasperation.
&ldquo;They use long holders to push the
small chunks of material into the holes in the
reactor. Then, as those uranium atoms keep
splitting up and shooting particles around inside
of the pile, some of them smack into the
chunks of material, and stick there. Most elements
will soak up radiation, just like a sponge
soaks up water.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;My, that&rsquo;s interesting, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them do it,&rdquo; Eddie said proudly,
then added, &ldquo;from behind a protective shield,
of course. When the material has soaked up
enough radiation, they pull it back out. They
say it&rsquo;s &lsquo;cooked.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it&rsquo;s hot?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;but not like if it
came out of a stove. By hot, they mean it&rsquo;s
radioactive. If you touched it, or even got near
it, you would get burned, but you probably
wouldn&rsquo;t even know it for a while. It would be
a radiation burn. That&rsquo;s a kind of burn you
don&rsquo;t feel, but it destroys your blood cells and
tissues, and&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ve had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what a radioisotope is,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a sponge. Only instead of soaking
up water, it soaks up radiation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;My dad says
that as more is learned about the ways to use
isotopes, the whole world is going to be improved.
You&rsquo;ve heard of radiocobalt for curing
cancer. Well, that&rsquo;s an isotope. They make it
by cooking cobalt in an atomic reactor. Oh,
there are hundreds of different isotopes. Like
I said, isotopes can be made of most of the
elements. And there are over a hundred elements.
Some soak up a lot of radioactivity, and
are strong and dangerous. Others absorb only
a little and are pretty safe to use. Depends, too,
on how long they let them cook in the reactor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind was the one stolen from the
college today?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t say exactly,&rdquo; Eddie answered,
&ldquo;except he did say that if whoever took it
didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing and opened up
the lead capsule, it could kill him. Of course,
even the mild isotopes are deadly if they&rsquo;re not
handled right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, it is a serious matter, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Eddie nodded. It was even more serious
than its threat of danger to anyone who
handled it carelessly. It was a new isotope&mdash;a
secret isotope. His father hadn&rsquo;t said whether
it had been developed for curing things or for
destroying things. But many radioisotopes
could do either; it depended on how they were
used. Eddie assumed that anyone who would
stoop to stealing isotopes more than likely
would be interested in their ability to destroy
rather than their ability to benefit mankind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I certainly do hope everything works
out all right,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Teena agreed.</p>
<p>Eddie glanced at the kitchen clock. &ldquo;Oh,
boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be heading back
home. I didn&rsquo;t mean to come over here and
talk so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re glad you did, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid too few of us know anything
about this atom business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Mrs. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie agreed.
&ldquo;People should talk more and read more about
it. After all, this is an atomic age. We might as
well face it. My father says that in horse-and-buggy
days everyone knew how to feed a horse
and grease a wagon wheel. They knew what was
needed to get the work done. But now that
atoms are being harnessed to do the work, not
many people even bother to find out what an
atom is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Ross smiled. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,
Eddie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t quite know
how to go about feeding an atom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or greasing one,&rdquo; Teena added.</p>
<p>Eddie laughed. &ldquo;I sure wouldn&rsquo;t want the
job of trying to feed a herd of them the size of
a period,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you know that there
are about three million billion atoms of carbon
in a single period printed at the end of a
sentence. That&rsquo;s how small atoms are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three million billion is a lot of something,&rdquo;
a man&rsquo;s voice spoke behind him.
&ldquo;What are we talking about, Eddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Mr. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie said, turning
around and standing up. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear you
come in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Teena&rsquo;s father was a medium-sized man
with light-brown hair which was getting somewhat
thin on top. He was usually quite cheerful
and full of fun, but tonight his face seemed
unusually drawn and sober. He stepped to the
table, leaned over, and gave both Teena and
Mrs. Ross a kiss on the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie was telling us about atoms,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s
mother said. &ldquo;Did you know there were three
million billion of them in a period?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many in a comma?&rdquo; Mr. Ross said to
Eddie, then added quickly, &ldquo;forget it, Eddie.
It wasn&rsquo;t very funny. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t feel
very funny tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Ross said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warm
your dinner. You didn&rsquo;t sound very cheerful
when you called to say you would be late. How
did everything go at the plant today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father said tiredly.
&ldquo;In fact, not good at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Problems. It seemed that everyone had
problems, Eddie thought, as he started to
leave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER THREE</h2>
<p>Three days later Eddie learned the nature of
the trouble at Acme Aircraft Company. It was
midmorning Saturday. Carrying a picnic
lunch, he and Teena were hiking along the
beach toward the distant U.S. Coast Guard
lighthouse which stood on a high point overlooking
Moon Bay. Old Captain Daniels, the
lightkeeper, had been a friend of theirs for
nearly two years. Every once in a while Teena
and Eddie went to visit &ldquo;Cap,&rdquo; as they fondly
called him. Teena would put up a picnic
lunch which they shared with the kindly old
man whose lonely vigil over the light had
warned ships off the rocky coast for a good
many years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Eddie wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly how the conversation
got around to Acme Aircraft Company. It
seemed that Teena mentioned something
about trouble. Eddie asked, &ldquo;What trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you read the paper this morning?&rdquo;
Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take the morning paper,&rdquo; Eddie
said. &ldquo;We take the <i>Globe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aircraft company has been keeping it
quiet,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;but somehow the news
leaked out. It was all in this morning&rsquo;s paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actually, Eddie doubted that he would have
noticed it, even if they had taken the morning
paper. The big thing around his house was the
disappearance of the radioisotope. No promising
clues had been found. The theft of the
isotope remained as much a mystery as it had
been from the first day. The few times he had
seen his father, he had noticed how much
deeper the lines of worry on his face had become.
Eddie had avoided asking questions, yet
he couldn&rsquo;t help wondering if his father was in
danger of losing his job at the college. Some
of the things his mother had said seemed to
hint at the possibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The newspapers had taken a dim view of the
robbery. They protested against the carelessness
which would enable the theft, in broad
daylight, of such a valuable, secret, and hazardous
thing as a radioactive isotope.</p>
<p>The blame, of course, fell primarily upon
Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not even
listening to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Eddie answered. &ldquo;What did
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely said that some important blueprints
are missing from my father&rsquo;s department
at Acme Aircraft,&rdquo; Teena explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe someone put them in the wrong
drawer or something,&rdquo; Eddie suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve looked everywhere, Eddie,&rdquo;
Teena said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why my father&rsquo;s been
getting home late every day. They&rsquo;ve searched
absolutely everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess they can always make new
blueprints,&rdquo; Eddie said. He really couldn&rsquo;t
see why it was so important, especially not if
you compared it to stolen radioisotopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rdquo; Teena said sharply.
&ldquo;They were top-secret blueprints&mdash;something
to do with guiding a new missile Acme Aircraft
is getting ready to make. If the plans
were stolen&mdash;well, you know what that could
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The importance of what Teena was saying
struck Eddie suddenly. Could there be any
connection between the missing blueprints
and the stolen isotope?</p>
<p>The idea sent a chill along Eddie&rsquo;s spine.
Perhaps there was a whole spy ring operating
around Oceanview!</p>
<p>He mentioned it to Teena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the same thing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But,
Eddie, we&rsquo;re not at war or anything. It&rsquo;s silly
to think there are spies and things like that
running around. That&rsquo;s comic-book stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to me, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
plenty of spying going on, war or no war. Every
once in a while you hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, you&rsquo;re just trying to scare me,&rdquo; Teena
said. She stopped and picked up a shell, looked
it over, then skipped it into the surf. Sandy
chased it, yipping happily, but turned and
scurried back just ahead of the foaming surf.</p>
<p>Eddie smiled. &ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m scaring myself, too. Anyway, if
we&rsquo;re going to hike all the way to the lighthouse,
we&rsquo;ll have to hurry up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they walked on up the coast, the sandy
beach gave way to rock formations which
jutted out into the ocean. They picked their
way carefully over the rocks. Now and then
they stopped to inspect some tide pool for
small crabs and other sea life left by the receding
water. Sandy was beside himself with
joy as he chased small crabs into rock crevices.</p>
<p>Teena found a starfish which she dropped
into a small cloth sack she had brought along.
Eddie had never been very interested in
gathering shells and other sea souvenirs, but
Teena had quite a collection at home.</p>
<p>They crossed over the rocks and dropped
down into a sandy cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone with a boat,&rdquo; Teena said,
pointing along the curving beach. A rowboat
was pulled up on the sand. Two men stood
beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fishermen,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if they
caught anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were several other small boats out
on Moon Bay. Eddie and his father had fished
the bay several times themselves. Although
shallow in places, there were spots in the bay
where good-sized perch and bass, and occasional
halibut were caught.</p>
<p>Eddie and Teena hurried along the beach.
The two men looked up as they approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; Eddie greeted. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men glanced at each other, seeming
to pass a silent question back and forth.</p>
<p>Eddie laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s O.K.,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know
most of the fishing spots out there. You won&rsquo;t
be giving away any secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="img" id="pic1">
<img src="images/i03.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; Eddie greeted. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;" width="500" height="557" />
<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; Eddie greeted. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets?&rdquo; one of the men said. He was tall
and thin. His cheekbones pushed sharply outward
against the sides of his face. His skin
was strangely white for that of a fisherman in
midsummer. Most week-end fishermen around
Oceanview had pretty good tans by this time.
Both men wore faded blue denims, white
sneakers, and bright-colored sports shirts. The
fact that their clothes looked new made Eddie
think it might be the first time they had fished
Moon Bay. The orange-and-white rowboat
pulled up on the sand had been rented from
Anderson&rsquo;s Landing. Both Eddie and Teena
knew Mr. Anderson well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know fishermen don&rsquo;t like to give away
their fishing secrets,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;so if you
caught any, you don&rsquo;t need to tell us where
you got them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man smiled then. He looked relieved,
Eddie thought. In appearance, he was
almost the opposite of his companion. He was
short and squat, almost fat. Despite the slight
cool breeze from the ocean, the warm sun
made his chubby face glisten with sweat. He
seemed a little more willing to smile than
the tall man. Eddie didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable
under his gaze, as he did under the stare of
the tall man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; the short man said,
&ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t been fishing yet. So I guess you
couldn&rsquo;t say we&rsquo;ve had any luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; Eddie said thoughtfully. Sandy
began sniffing around the rowboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get that mutt away from there,&rdquo; the tall
man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t hurt anything, mister,&rdquo; Eddie
assured him.</p>
<p>He went over, though, and took hold of
Sandy&rsquo;s collar. As he did so he glanced into
the beached rowboat. There were no fish, or
even signs of fish. There were a couple bamboo
poles which Eddie recognized also as having
been rented from Anderson&rsquo;s Landing.
There was a box, probably the men&rsquo;s lunch.</p>
<p>And under the plank seat stretching across
the beam Eddie saw a round metal cylinder.
At first he thought it was the kind of tube
used as a carrying case to hold the sections of
a jointed trout rod, but as he got a better look,
it didn&rsquo;t seem long enough for that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Besides, who would use a light trout rod
for ocean fishing? It wouldn&rsquo;t be any good to
catch the big bass which were sometimes
caught in the bay. It&rsquo;d probably snap in two
if you tried to horse a halibut in with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at, kid?&rdquo; The tall
man&rsquo;s harsh voice jerked Eddie out of his
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stay away from the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Simms,&rdquo; the short man said.
&ldquo;These kids don&rsquo;t mean any harm. They&mdash;they&rsquo;re
not trying to steal our fishing secrets.
Now, are you?&rdquo; He smiled at Teena, displaying
a mouthful of yellowish uneven teeth.</p>
<p>Looking at those teeth made Eddie mighty
glad his teeth would never look like that.
What little bother his braces and the cleaning
were would sure be worth it in the long run.
He never wanted yellow, uneven teeth like
that man had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say we wouldn&rsquo;t try to steal any
fishing secrets,&rdquo; Teena answered the fat man&rsquo;s
question. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to all the fish you
can catch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care how you catch them, or
what with,&rdquo; Eddie added, &ldquo;long as it&rsquo;s legal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;re on our way to visit Captain
Daniels at the lighthouse,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Come
on, Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away mad,&rdquo; the heavy-set man
said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go, Roy,&rdquo; Simms said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie motioned to Teena and called Sandy.
He had intended to tell the men of a good
fishing spot only a few hundred yards out from
the cove, but the way the men acted made him
change his mind.</p>
<p>At the far end of the cove, Eddie and Teena
stopped and turned to watch the two men as
they shoved the rowboat into the calm surf
and climbed in clumsily over the side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, I&rsquo;m glad all fishermen aren&rsquo;t like
that,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;That tall man sure acted
mean. I hope they don&rsquo;t catch any fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they will,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I saw
their bait can. Know what they&rsquo;re using?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand crabs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s what they should be using.
They had some old dried up mussels. The fish
here in Moon Bay don&rsquo;t bite on mussel. Dad
and I have tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wonder why Mr. Anderson sold
it to them,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Mr. Anderson
usually helps the fishermen. It&rsquo;s good for his
boat-rental business to sell the right bait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they didn&rsquo;t even ask what kind of
bait was best,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;They probably
grabbed the first thing they came to. And Mr.
Anderson always has a few mussels in his bait
bins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think fishing was so good in the
middle of the day,&rdquo; Teena said. She pointed
out across the water. &ldquo;See, most of the boats
have gone ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;If those guys
wanted to catch fish they should have been
out there early this morning when the big
ones were biting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess they don&rsquo;t know much about fishing,
huh, Eddie?&rdquo; Teena said, smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I figure,&rdquo; Eddie agreed. &ldquo;Besides,
they didn&rsquo;t even act like fishermen. That
tall fellow really was a grouch. First time I
ever ran across a grouchy fisherman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, let&rsquo;s quit worrying about them,&rdquo;
Teena suggested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost noon. We want
to reach the lighthouse before Cap has lunch.
He can&rsquo;t very well eat his lunch and ours, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; Eddie agreed, taking one last glance
at the two men rowing out on the blue water
of the bay. &ldquo;But something smells fishy about
those two&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean the kind you
catch on a hook!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
<p>The lighthouse was a tall concrete finger,
painted dazzling white with broad red rings
around it. It stood on the top of a rock palisade
which rose steeply from the beach. Steel stairs
spiraled upward on the outside, leading to the
strong glass-enclosed electric eye at the top.</p>
<p>Eddie and Teena paused on the beach below
and looked up. Crude steps hewn out of
the rocks led up to the lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carry the lunch,&rdquo; Eddie volunteered.
&ldquo;And be careful. The sea spray can make those
steps slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>They took their time getting to the top.
Sandy went ahead, sniffing in every crevice on
the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; Teena gasped as they reached the
base of the lighthouse. &ldquo;There seem to be
more steps every time we climb it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie smiled and shifted the lunch sack to
his other hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting old, Teena,&rdquo;
he teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome aboard, mates,&rdquo; a deep, kindly
voice spoke from nearby.</p>
<p>They turned and saw Captain Daniels
standing outside the door of his living
quarters, a tiny three-room cottage located
about fifty feet from the base of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Captain Daniels,&rdquo; Teena called.
&ldquo;Sure glad you&rsquo;re home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home?&rdquo; the former sea captain said, smiling.
&ldquo;A lightkeeper is always home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>In Eddie&rsquo;s opinion, Captain Daniels looked
exactly like an old ship&rsquo;s captain or a lightkeeper
should look. He wore a fringe of white
beard which formed a half-circle, starting
under one ear and curving across his chin
and up the other side. His bushy white hair
fairly exploded from beneath the battered
dark-blue seaman&rsquo;s cap which he wore even
while eating. Eddie sometimes wondered if
Captain Daniels wore the cap to bed.</p>
<p>The old mariner also had sharp blue eyes.
Eddie pictured all stout seamen as having
sharp blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We brought a little lunch with us, Captain
Daniels,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Hope you haven&rsquo;t
eaten already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A twinkle came into Cap&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I might
have,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I reckon I better confess
that I saw you through my telescope coming
up the beach. Thought I&rsquo;d better hold off on
lunch&mdash;just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we eat outside?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawn&rsquo;s nice and dry,&rdquo; Cap said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make it a picnic,&rdquo; Eddie suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea, mate,&rdquo; the retired seafarer said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Captain Daniels took great pride in his
small patch of grass. It seemed to grow right
out of the rock on which the lighthouse stood.
However, Captain Daniels had hauled in topsoil
from miles away and spread it carefully to
make the lawn. He tended it, and the flower
beds which bordered it, with an affection that
seemed strangely out of place for a swashbuckling
ship&rsquo;s captain who had roamed the
seven seas.</p>
<p>The three of them sat down on the lawn.
Teena passed around the sandwiches, opened
the potato chips, and unwrapped the pickles
and olives.</p>
<p>They ate for a while in silence, looking off
across the blue water of the bay toward the
open ocean beyond. Eddie&rsquo;s gaze followed the
curving shore line to the north. Land&rsquo;s end
in that direction was Cedar Point, which
stuck its rocky finger out into the ocean. It
was wildly rugged country, difficult to get to
except by boat across the bay. Eddie supposed
that was why the lighthouse had been built
on the smaller point located on the more
civilized curve of the bay. Yet the lighthouse
was high and plainly visible to ships at sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Captain Daniels finished his lunch, dug a
pipe from his pocket, and tamped tobacco into
the bowl. &ldquo;Mighty good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sure nice
of you young folks to share your rations with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we like to do it, Captain Daniels,&rdquo;
Teena said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much fun coming up here
to visit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve been reading in the
papers,&rdquo; the lightkeeper said, &ldquo;I hardly expected
to see you for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the stolen isotope?&rdquo; Eddie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much about isotopes,&rdquo; Cap
said, &ldquo;but I do know that the newspapers have
been making your father walk the plank for
letting it be stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; Eddie defended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Captain Daniels agreed.
&ldquo;But someone always gets blamed. Just like
those missing blueprints I read about in this
morning&rsquo;s paper. Teena&rsquo;s father probably has
nothing to do with guarding them, but when
they turn up missing, he&rsquo;s the one who gets
lashed to the mast. The captain of a ship takes
the blame for everything that happens aboard.
Actually, that&rsquo;s the way it should be, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Eddie had to agree, but he didn&rsquo;t like to
think about the worry his father and Mr. Ross
were going through. He had been trying not
to think about it.</p>
<p>Captain Daniels seemed to sense this. He
quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to be many fishermen out today,&rdquo;
he said, looking off across the bay. &ldquo;And
there&rsquo;s one boat out there that could just as
well have stayed ashore. Won&rsquo;t catch anything
worth frying out there on top of the sand bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rowboat had been anchored over the
light-blue strip of water which marked the
familiar sand bar stretching nearly a half mile
across the middle of the bay. The sand bar
lay about ten feet beneath the surface of the
water. It was marked by three buoys, one at
each end and one in the middle. Deep-draft
boats avoided the sand bar. Fishermen kept
away from it, as the larger fish lay in deeper
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the boat with those two men,
Eddie?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Eddie said, squinting through
the sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What two men?&rdquo; Cap asked.</p>
<p>Quickly Eddie told him about the two
strangers he and Teena had come across at
the cove. Captain Daniels reached into his
pocket and brought out a small telescope. He
pulled its sections out to full length and
handed it to Eddie. &ldquo;See for yourself,&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>Eddie adjusted the lens to his vision. With
the telescope it was easy to see that the two
men in the rowboat were the tall one called
Simms and the chunky one called Roy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t seem to
be pulling in any fish.&rdquo; He passed the telescope
to Teena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like they&rsquo;re even trying,&rdquo;
Teena said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one line in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re just relaxing,&rdquo; Captain
Daniels said. &ldquo;Some people don&rsquo;t care whether
they catch any fish or not. They rent a boat,
row it out and anchor it, and then sit around
soothing their nerves. People build up a lot of
tensions these days, you know. Folks have different
ways of getting rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were nervous, all right,&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;Especially the tall one.&rdquo; She handed the
telescope back to Captain Daniels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s forget about them,&rdquo; Eddie suggested.
&ldquo;Captain Daniels, would you like us to
help polish the light again today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you&rsquo;re always welcome to help
with that,&rdquo; the lightkeeper said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
want you coming up here thinking I expect
you to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that isn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie agreed with that. Not only was it fun,
but it was a great thrill to climb up to the top
of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Captain Daniels got some rags and a can
of window cleaner out of a small tool shed at
the foot of the lighthouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let us do it today, Captain
Daniels?&rdquo; Teena asked. &ldquo;No use in your
climbing all of those stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; the lightkeeper said, smiling.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie and Teena took the rags and cleaner
and started up the steel stairs which spiraled
up the outside to the top of the lighthouse.
The stairs were perfectly safe, as a waist-high
railing prevented any possibility of an accident.</p>
<p>Reaching the top, they paused on the narrow
steel balcony that circled the light. The
view across the bay was spectacular&mdash;blue
water and whitecaps as far as they could see.
A couple of steamers dragged banners of
smoke across the distant horizon. In the other
direction they saw Oceanview sprawling out
inland from the shore of the bay. Both Acme
Aircraft Company and the college campus
were in plain view.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>After filling themselves with the view, they
got busy on the light. It was like polishing a
giant lantern chimney. It had thick, wavy
glass to magnify the beam of the enormous
electric lamp which rotated inside, making
three complete turns a minute. Being daytime,
the light was turned off. In fact, Eddie never
had seen the light up close at night. He imagined
it would be very blinding, although
he doubted if anyone ever would be foolish
enough to climb up and look into it. It was
bright enough, even from a distance, as it
swept its white warning finger through the
sky.</p>
<p>He and Teena worked away at spreading
the window cleaner. After it had dried on the
thick glass, they went over it carefully with
their soft rags. The dirt and the white deposit
left from the salt spray came off easily, leaving
the glass bright as crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; Eddie said, after they
had made a complete circle of the glass. He
paused to take one last look around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be getting back home, too,&rdquo;
Teena suggested. &ldquo;It must be three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie glanced up at the sun. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re about
right,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>They made their way back down the stairs.
Cap was waiting at the bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as bright as the northern star, mates,&rdquo;
he said, craning his neck to get a good look at
their handiwork. &ldquo;I sure do thank you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones to thank you for letting us
come out here to visit you, Captain Daniels,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time,&rdquo; the old mariner invited.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always welcome. And I don&rsquo;t expect
you to bring a lunch or polish the light,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to go now,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ll come out to see you again before long.
Come on, Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be looking for you,&rdquo; Captain Daniels
called after them, as they started down the
rock steps toward the beach.</p>
<p>Later, when they reached the cove they
noticed that the rowboat was no longer
anchored out over the sand bar. Then Eddie
saw it in close to shore, heading for Anderson&rsquo;s
Landing. He didn&rsquo;t give it any more thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>As they approached Anderson&rsquo;s Landing,
the two strangers were tying up at the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if they caught anything,&rdquo; Eddie
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; Teena objected. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t
very nice to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;Maybe someone should tell them that the
fishing is no good over the sand bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they found that out for themselves,&rdquo;
Teena said.</p>
<p>But Eddie already had started walking out
onto the plank boat dock. Teena followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, mister, I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; Eddie offered
as the heavy-set man removed the oars from
the oarlocks and moved toward the prow of
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; the man said, trying to keep his
balance in the rocking boat. Then he glanced
up. &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re the kids we saw earlier, aren&rsquo;t
you? You following us or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;We were on our
way home. Just thought we&rsquo;d come out and
see what kind of luck you had.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;We did all right, didn&rsquo;t we, Roy?&rdquo; the tall
man said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are your fish?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We left them in the bay,&rdquo; Roy, the portly
man, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Eddie said, smiling. &ldquo;No one
ever catches any fish out over the sand bar.
The fish hang around in the deeper water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t care much for fish, anyway,&rdquo;
Roy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you go fishing?&rdquo; Teena
wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do it to get away from kids who ask
silly questions,&rdquo; Simms said curtly. &ldquo;Now beat
it and leave us alone.&rdquo; He tossed the two fishing
poles onto the dock and climbed out of
the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, mister,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
mean to bother you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get sore, kids,&rdquo; Roy said. &ldquo;Simms
is a little sunburned, that&rsquo;s all. Makes him
cranky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The tall man was sunburned, all right.
Eddie had noticed that. But then, he had expected
it. Neither man boasted any kind of
a tan, and the sun had been hot all afternoon.</p>
<p>Eddie also had noticed something else. It
struck him as strange, although he didn&rsquo;t
know what to make of it. The metal tube
which he had noticed in the bottom of the
boat when they had first met the men in the
cove was no longer in sight.</p>
<p>If it had contained a collapsible fishing rod
as he had guessed, why wasn&rsquo;t it still there in
the bottom of the boat? Eddie was certain the
men hadn&rsquo;t put in to shore between the time
they had left the cove and now. If they had he
and Teena would have noticed it from the
lighthouse.</p>
<p>A metal tube like the one Eddie had seen
earlier in the bottom of the rowboat simply
would not disappear. Perhaps it hadn&rsquo;t contained
a collapsible fishing rod, as he had
guessed. If not, what was in the cylinder?</p>
<p>And where was it now?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
<p>Nearly a week went by. The lead capsule containing
the stolen radioisotope had not been
found. In fact, as far as Eddie knew, there
had been no worthwhile clues on which to
base a search. Curious as he was, Eddie still
managed to keep from asking his father a lot
of questions. Around home, Mr. Taylor had
been thoughtfully silent. Eddie knew that his
father must be very worried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Eddie gathered enough from the conversations
between his parents to know that the
search for the stolen isotope was still going on.
In fact, it was pretty well known that FBI
agents had arrived in Oceanview to lend a
hand. Eddie hadn&rsquo;t seen them, but several of
his friends had. It was hard to keep secrets in
a college town like Oceanview.</p>
<p>The newspapers had temporarily dropped
the story. After all, when the radioisotope had
been stolen it had made a big story, but
nothing more had happened, so there was
nothing more to write about.</p>
<p>There were still articles in the newspapers
about the Acme Aircraft Company problem
of the missing blueprints. Actually, it seemed
to Eddie that the newspapers were making
more of a mystery out of the missing blueprints
than of the stolen radioisotopes. Perhaps
that was because it had not yet been
decided whether the blueprints had been
stolen, destroyed by accident, or simply lost.
In an aircraft plant, where thousands and
thousands of plans are being used at all times,
some carelessness is apt to occur. Eddie found
it hard to believe that anyone could get careless
with top-secret blueprints, yet such things
did happen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Maybe the reason people remained curious
about the missing blueprints was that everyone
knew what a blueprint was. Even the
word &ldquo;radioisotope&rdquo; meant very little to most
readers. What they were and what they did
were even less well known.</p>
<p>Friday morning Teena came whistling up
to the back door at Eddie&rsquo;s house to see if he
wanted to do anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s gone shopping,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
be back in a few minutes. Then maybe we
could take the Geiger counter and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were interrupted by the telephone
ringing inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be right back,&rdquo; he said, hurrying into the
house.</p>
<p>His father was on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a dark-green notebook
on my desk in the study. I forgot it this
morning. Can&rsquo;t get away from here, and I
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring it over, Dad,&rdquo; Eddie volunteered
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I&rsquo;ll be outside the botany building.
Know where that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Botany? Where they raise all the plants
and stuff?&rdquo; Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where it is,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Be there
in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went into the study, got the notebook
off the desk, and went back outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to tear over to school with this
notebook,&rdquo; he explained to Teena. &ldquo;That was
my dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only a few blocks to the college
campus. Reaching the grounds, they took a
short cut past the men&rsquo;s gymnasium, crossed
the athletic field, and arrived at the Botany
Building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see Dad over there,&rdquo; Eddie said, pointing.
There were several men standing in a
group in the small cultivated field which the
botany department used to grow test plants
of various kinds. Eddie and Teena picked
their way carefully between the rows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made good time, Eddie,&rdquo; his father
said, taking the notebook. &ldquo;Morning, Teena.
Hope I didn&rsquo;t interrupt any big plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mr. Taylor,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;We
weren&rsquo;t doing anything special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie was about to turn and leave, when
he noticed that several of the young men&mdash;students,
no doubt&mdash;were wearing strange-looking,
long, heavy gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the gloves, Dad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor glanced up from the notebook.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re experimenting with radioactive tracers,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re weak&mdash;certainly not
dangerous&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no harm in taking a
little extra precaution. The gloves are lead-lined
and absorb any of the rays which might
possibly be picked up from handling the
plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are tracers, Mr. Taylor?&rdquo; Teena
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Eddie shot her a quick scowl. He doubted
that his father wanted to be bothered with
questions at the moment. Then Eddie noticed
one of the students holding the wandlike
probe&mdash;or diode&mdash;of a Geiger counter down
close to the leaves of one plant. It seemed a
strange thing to be doing. Who would
prospect for uranium in plants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good question, Teena,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor
said. &ldquo;Glad to see you&rsquo;re interested.&rdquo; He
turned and spoke to the student with the
Geiger counter. &ldquo;Jim, you want to explain
to this young lady, and my son here, what
tracers are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie smiled to himself. His father was the
kind of a professor who believed his students
should have the chance to use their knowledge
whenever possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we should all listen to this,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s
father said to the others.</p>
<p>They gathered around as the dark-haired
student switched off the Geiger counter,
swallowed a bit uncomfortably, and turned to
face the outdoor classroom which Teena&rsquo;s
question had formed on the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, er&mdash;&rdquo; Jim began, addressing Teena,
&ldquo;a tracer is a radioactive isotope which we&mdash;well,
send out on a journey, then follow it
with a Geiger counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s not too clear, Jim,&rdquo; Mr.
Taylor said. &ldquo;Teena&rsquo;s not an atomic scientist.
Can you simplify it for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know what a radioactive isotope is,
Mr. Taylor,&rdquo; Teena said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father said in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something&mdash;I think you call it an element&mdash;which
they put in an atomic reactor,
and&mdash;and cook it until it becomes radioactive.
Kind of like a sponge soaking up water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor nodded, obviously
impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie explained it to me,&rdquo; Teena said,
smiling, &ldquo;but he didn&rsquo;t say anything about
tracers.&rdquo; She turned her attention back to Jim,
the student.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jim said, seeming more at ease,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s look at it this way. Any radioisotope
keeps shooting out rays. Of course, you can&rsquo;t
see the rays with your eyes. They&rsquo;re almost
too small to think about. But you can follow
them with a Geiger counter.&rdquo; He indicated
the black metal instrument which he still held
in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jim went on, &ldquo;say, for instance, that
you wanted to know how fast a stream of
water flows. You might toss in a rubber ball
and time how long it takes to float a mile
downstream. That would give you its speed.
Or say you wanted to know which way its
currents twist and turn. You might dump in
a gallon of ink and watch it follow the currents.
In a way, the ball and the ink are tracers.
Not radioactive tracers, of course, but by
watching how they act, you learn what you
want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about radioactive tracers,&rdquo; Eddie
said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crowding me, bub,&rdquo; Jim said,
smiling. Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we using tracers here, Jim?&rdquo; Mr.
Taylor prompted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re testing the use of phosphate in plant
growth,&rdquo; the student explained. &ldquo;We want to
know what the plant does with it. Does a
phosphate fertilizer merely feed the plant&rsquo;s
roots, or is it pulled up into the stems and
leaves? And we want to know how quickly the
plant absorbs it, if at all. Of course, we can&rsquo;t
see it, but if we make the phosphate slightly
radioactive, then we have what we call a tracer.
By using a Geiger counter, we can follow or
trace its movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you explain our method, Jim?&rdquo; Mr.
Taylor said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we spread a little of the radioactive
phosphate around the plant,&rdquo; the student said.
&ldquo;Soon the roots start taking it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that, Jim?&rdquo; Mr. Taylor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hold the Geiger counter to the root.
If it starts clicking faster than usual, we know
the root has absorbed some of the phosphate
tracer. We also hold the Geiger counter over
the stems and leaves. As the tracer works upward
into the plant, the Geiger counter reacts
to it. Here, let me show you how it works on
this cotton plant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Eddie and Teena moved over closer to the
two-foot-high plant. Jim switched on the Geiger
counter. Eddie saw the needle on the gauge
flutter slightly, indicating the normal cosmic-ray
background count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teena,&rdquo; Jim said, handing her the earphones
which were attached by a long wire
to the Geiger counter, &ldquo;you take these earphones.
Now, I&rsquo;ll pass the probe down close
to the base of the cotton bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the stick do?&rdquo; Teena asked. Although
Eddie had explained it to her, she
seemed to feel that, as a pupil, she should ask
some questions to help Jim out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick? Oh, you mean the probe. Actually,
it&rsquo;s called a diode, but probe&rsquo;s easier to remember.
Anyway, the probe is a vacuum tube
filled with a special kind of gas. Whenever invisible
radioactive particles shoot through the
probe and into the gas, the Geiger counter
clicks, and the needle on the dial moves forward.
The more rays shooting through the
probe, the more clicks; the more clicks, the
more radioactivity. That&rsquo;s why Geiger counters
are so useful in hunting for uranium.
Uranium is very, very radioactive. If you
happen onto some uranium ore, the Geiger
counter really goes wild.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have a Geiger counter at home,&rdquo; Eddie
said eagerly. &ldquo;Teena and I have gone uranium
prospecting several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t found any uranium,&rdquo; Teena said,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve had fun trying. Whoops. There&rsquo;s
some clicking!&rdquo; She put her hands up to the
earphones.</p>
<p>Jim had moved the probe down close to the
stem of the cotton plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We mixed a little radioactive
phosphate into the ground around the
roots this morning. See, the Geiger counter
shows that the phosphate tracer has already
started moving up into the plant. Helps show
how important phosphate is to plant growth,
and how eagerly the plants absorb it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plant sure looks healthy enough, all
right,&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see how far
up into the plant the tracer has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>He moved the probe upward over the
smaller twigs and leaves. On the lower leaves
the Geiger counter kept clicking rapidly.
Eddie watched the needle stay forward on the
gauge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, the leaves have taken a lot of it in already,&rdquo;
Jim explained.</p>
<p>Then, as he moved the probe farther up
toward the top of the plant, the clicking diminished
until only the familiar slow background
count remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It quit,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shows that the phosphate has only reached
about half of the plant so far,&rdquo; Jim said. &ldquo;You
see, with the tracer and the Geiger counter we
can tell just how far it has gone and how long
it has taken. We can even tell how much has
been absorbed by comparing the amount of
radioactivity in the leaves and stems of the
plant to what we know was contained in the
original tracer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;By adding tracers to some fertilizers,&rdquo; Jim
went on, &ldquo;we found that the plant made no
use of the fertilizer. The Geiger counter didn&rsquo;t
pick up any radioactivity in the plant. Meant
wasted money to any farmer or gardener who
used it. Now do you see what we mean by a
tracer? See how radioactive tracers can be
helpful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet if I had some of that tracer I
wouldn&rsquo;t lose so many things,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I
could paint a little on my marbles or sling-shot.
Then I could always find them with a
Geiger counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could, at that,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;And
I wouldn&rsquo;t be stepping on the marbles in my
bare feet. But, of course, great care must be
taken in handling radioisotopes, which is what
tracers are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Jim had warmed up to the subject, and
wasn&rsquo;t quite ready to drop it. &ldquo;Tracers are
used in many ways,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They are
used in medicine to locate diseased tissue
which attracts and absorbs certain isotopes.
A radiation-sensitive instrument, similar to a
super Geiger counter, sniffs out the isotope
and locates the damaged tissue. Then the
doctor knows what to treat, or where to operate.
Radioisotopes are used in various food
tests. By watching the tracer with electronic
gadgets, they can tell whether the food is a
muscle builder, a bone builder, or what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make machine parts radioactive,&rdquo;
Mr. Taylor said. &ldquo;Then by seeing how many
radioactive particles are in the oil after the
machine has been run, you can tell how much
wear the machine has taken. Oh, there are
hundreds of ways to use radioactive tracers.
You might call them atomic signposts. Using
a Geiger counter to read the signs, you are
directed along the paths that lead to the
answers of nature&rsquo;s mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty flowery, at that, I guess,&rdquo; his father
said, smiling. &ldquo;Well, anyway, Jim, you did a
nice job of explaining it. Now, I think we&rsquo;d
better get back to our work. Thanks for
bringing the notebook over, Eddie&mdash;and
Teena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young people turned and started
back toward Eddie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go across the mall,&rdquo; Teena suggested.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been over here for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mall, as it was always called, was a
broad ribbon of lawn which stretched for more
than a block down the center of the college
campus. It was bordered on both sides by the
many buildings which made up Oceanview
College. Sidewalks laced back and forth across
the mall. During class changes, the area
swarmed with students. Now, as Eddie and
Teena walked along the mall, only a few students
sauntered around or sat loafing in front
of the buildings waiting for their next class.</p>
<p>Teena and Eddie walked past the library,
the assembly hall, and the nuclear-science
building. They were starting past the chemistry
building, when Eddie tugged at Teena&rsquo;s
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the back of a
man walking about fifty yards ahead of them.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; Teena asked. &ldquo;You mean
that man? Am I supposed to know him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;He sure looks
familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell? All we can see is his
back. Lots of backs look alike. He&rsquo;s tall. Maybe
he&rsquo;s a basketball player. He looks older than
most students, though. Why, his hair&rsquo;s even a
little gray, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it now,&rdquo; Eddie interrupted. &ldquo;The
tall and kind of gray part. You know who?
Simms. That fellow we ran into down at the
cove last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well-ll, maybe,&rdquo; Teena admitted thoughtfully.
&ldquo;We could tell for sure if he&rsquo;d turn
around. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t see what difference
it makes. Maybe he&rsquo;s a student here. There are
a lot of older students. Maybe he&rsquo;s even a
teacher. Lots of teachers fish on week ends.
No reason to get excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s excited?&rdquo; Eddie challenged. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
a fellow ask&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., O.K.,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Anyway, there
he goes into the chemistry building, so we&rsquo;ll
never know just who it was. And that&rsquo;s the end
of your mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t say anything. He walked
along, busy with his own thoughts. Probably
Teena was right. Why make a mystery of it?
Even if the man were Simms, what difference
would it make?</p>
<p>Yet, why had Simms acted so strange and
unfriendly that day. And for no reason Eddie
could think of. There was also the memory of
the strange metal tube which had been in the
rowboat when the two men went fishing, and
wasn&rsquo;t there when they returned.</p>
<p>There was no point in even mentioning it
to Teena, but Eddie had a strangely uncomfortable
feeling on seeing the man right there
on the campus from which the secret radioisotope
had been stolen recently.</p>
<p>No, it really couldn&rsquo;t mean a thing, Eddie
told himself.</p>
<p>Then, again, maybe it could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER SIX</h2>
<p>Eddie had hoped that the following day he
and Teena could make the trip to Cedar Point
with the Geiger counter. It had been in the
back of his mind ever since his dream of
locating radioactive ore on the rocky point.
But by the time he finished mowing his lawn
and doing the few other chores lined up for
him, it was too late to attempt the long trip.</p>
<p>Besides, the only sensible way to get to
Cedar Point was by boat across Moon Bay. It
was a two-mile row each way. Yet, protected by
sand bars, the bay usually remained quite
calm. By taking it easy, it was no great job
rowing out to the point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Still, you had to have a rowboat. To rent
one cost money. With so many things going
on during summer vacation, Eddie simply
hadn&rsquo;t been able to save out of his allowance.</p>
<p>He knew of a way to get a boat, though. He
had done it a couple of times before. There
were more than two dozen rowboats at Anderson&rsquo;s
Landing. Seldom were they all rented at
once.</p>
<p>On this particular Saturday, a gray blanket
of high fog hung in the sky. Eddie had an idea
that quite a few of the boats would still be tied
up at Anderson&rsquo;s Landing. Right after lunch
he hurried over to Teena&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to go down to Anderson&rsquo;s
Landing,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;and see if we
can&rsquo;t earn a day&rsquo;s rental on one of the boats?
Then maybe next week we can take that trip
out to Cedar Point with the Geiger counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to earn the use of a rowboat
again?&rdquo; Teena asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. It&rsquo;s not so hard,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Want
to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Eddie and Teena arrived at the beach.
Mr. Anderson was midway out on the wharf
which jutted a hundred or so feet out into the
smooth water of the bay. They trotted out
across the rough planking to see him. The
boatowner was a small, wiry man with deep
wrinkles around his eyes from years of squinting
against the reflection of sun on water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;Where are your
fishing poles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to fish today, Mr. Anderson,&rdquo;
Eddie said. &ldquo;Do you have any odd jobs
we can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need a boat?&rdquo; the owner guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to row out
to Cedar Point one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Eddie&rsquo;s a good rower,&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;Sometimes I even help with one of the oars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, rubbing
his bristly chin, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d need a boat almost a
full day to row out to Cedar Point and back.
At fifty cents an hour, that&rsquo;s quite a bit of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any money, Mr. Anderson,&rdquo;
Eddie explained. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we hoped we
could work it out. Remember, I&rsquo;ve done it
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said. &ldquo;And I
remember that you&rsquo;re a pretty good worker,
too.&rdquo; He glanced along the wharf at the rowboats
tied up to a row of cleats. &ldquo;Tell you what.
You clean out what boats are in, and you&rsquo;ve
earned yourselves a day&rsquo;s rental on one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie counted the boats quickly. There
were fourteen of them not in use. Depending
upon how messy various fishermen had been,
he and Teena should be able to clean them up
in about three hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, Teena?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right by me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal, Mr. Anderson,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;And thanks a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just when do you figure you will want the
boat?&rdquo; the owner asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe next Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You do the job, and I&rsquo;ll save
you one. Make it a good job, mind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started with the boat near the far end
of the wharf, and worked shoreward. They
wiped off the seats with a damp rag and coiled
the anchor ropes neatly near the bow. The
biggest job, though, was cleaning up the junk
which had gathered in the bottom of each boat
during the week. There were candy wrappers,
smelly chunks of old bait, snarled bits of
leader, occasional fishhooks, even dried-out
sandwich crusts and other odds and ends which
had collected in each boat.</p>
<p>While they were working, two more boats
returned. Eddie checked their numbers when
they came in. Then, after he and Teena had
finished cleaning up the fourteen, they went
back and did the two new arrivals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;ve earned a boat for next
Saturday,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, glancing approvingly
at their work. &ldquo;And thanks for
cleaning up those extra two that came in.
They weren&rsquo;t actually in the bargain, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were glad to do them,&rdquo; Eddie said,
feeling a bit proud that they had done more
than the bargain called for. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d
better be going now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes another boat,&rdquo; Teena said,
pointing to one of the orange-and-white Anderson&rsquo;s
Landing rowboats about a hundred
yards out from the wharf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, smiling,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be staying around to clean that
one up. I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teena, look,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s those
same two men we met at the cove last week.
You know, the tall one called Simms and the
chubby one called Roy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Benton,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, consulting
his rental slips. &ldquo;He signed for the boat
this morning. Second Saturday they&rsquo;ve rented
one. Hope they&rsquo;re steady customers. I can always
use the business. Don&rsquo;t know how long
they&rsquo;ll stick with it, though. They didn&rsquo;t catch
a thing last week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bet they didn&rsquo;t catch any this week,
either,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Not if they fished over
the sand bar again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to tell them about good fishin&rsquo;
spots,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said, &ldquo;but they didn&rsquo;t
seem to be listening. Didn&rsquo;t even ask me what
kind of bait was best around here. Well, there
are all kinds of fishermen. One thing I&rsquo;ve
learned in this business is not to go around
giving advice when no one asks for it. Fishermen
can be mighty touchy about that. Best to
let them use up their own pet ideas, even if
they don&rsquo;t catch fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure why they would want to take
trout rods out with them to do ocean fishing,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trout rods?&rdquo; Mr. Anderson asked. &ldquo;They
rented poles from me. I didn&rsquo;t see any trout
rods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, remember that metal tube they had
last week? About two feet long? If that wasn&rsquo;t
a carrying case for a jointed trout rod, what
else could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect them having anything like
that,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson said thoughtfully. &ldquo;And
I sure would have noticed it. I helped them
get loaded in the boat. All they had was a small
box which I figured was their lunch. Same
thing this morning. No metal tubes with
knock-down trout rods or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena prompted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
just as soon not have to meet them again. They
were pretty cranky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tall man at the oars already was
maneuvering the boat clumsily up to the
wharf. Mr. Anderson leaned down, took the
painter from the fat man&rsquo;s hand, and snubbed
it to the dock cleat.</p>
<p>The tall man, Simms, shipped oars and
turned around to hand them up to Mr. Anderson.
He spotted Eddie and Teena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so it&rsquo;s you two again,&rdquo; he said with no
show of friendliness. &ldquo;You keep turning up,
and we&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re spying on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been helping Mr. Anderson,&rdquo;
Teena defended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fish again today?&rdquo; Eddie said, looking
into the empty boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Snagged a couple whoppers,&rdquo; the portly
man said, &ldquo;but they got away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hook them over the sand bar?&rdquo;
Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Simms said sharply.</p>
<p>Eddie glanced at Mr. Anderson. You just
couldn&rsquo;t hook big ones over the sand bar. The
boat owner shrugged at Eddie&rsquo;s inquiring
look, but he said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them next week, though,&rdquo; the
man, Roy Benton, said. &ldquo;You save us a boat
for next Saturday, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson made a note of it.</p>
<p>Before Eddie nodded to Teena that they
should be leaving, he noticed that there was
no metal tube lying in the bottom of the boat.
Had he been seeing things last Saturday? After
all, even Mr. Anderson claimed the men
hadn&rsquo;t brought anything along except a lunch
of some kind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Eddie was quite sure it hadn&rsquo;t been imagination,
but he didn&rsquo;t know why the vision of
the round metal cylinder kept coming into his
mind. And anything he couldn&rsquo;t explain
bothered Eddie a lot.</p>
<p>At the foot of the wharf Teena said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
early yet, Eddie. Let&rsquo;s take a hike up the beach,
shall we? Maybe we could even go as far as the
lighthouse and say hello to Cap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; Eddie agreed. He never got
tired of walking along the beach. There was
always something new to see and do. The fresh
ocean breeze on his face and the soft sand underfoot
made him feel good. Nor did he ever
tire of picking pebbles off the beach and skipping
them across the smooth water of the bay.</p>
<p>A little while later they were almost to the
cove when a piece of green material caught
Eddie&rsquo;s gaze. It was being gently buffeted up
and down on the sand by the small lapping
waves. He trotted over and picked it out of
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you find, Eddie?&rdquo; Teena called
from nearby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a piece of rubber,&rdquo; Eddie said, holding
up the four-inch length of green material.
&ldquo;Looks like part of a strap off someone&rsquo;s swim
fins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, you&rsquo;re some beachcomber,&rdquo; Teena
teased. &ldquo;An old strap off someone&rsquo;s swim fin is
some treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie drew back his arm and was about to
throw the scrap back into the water, when
some printing which was molded into the rubber
caught his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said, looking at it closely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
got some kind of foreign words on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;I guess they make
swim fins all over the world. Probably some
tourist from another country brought them.
There are quite a few tourists around here
during the summer, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Eddie admitted, but he
stuffed the scrap of rubber into his pocket and
walked on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>In a little while they arrived at the cove
where they had come across the two men a
week earlier. Owing to the rocks and the rather
poor beach, the cove was seldom visited by
bathers. There was really little reason for fishermen
to put into the cove, either. That was
why it had puzzled him to find the two men at
the cove the previous Saturday. However, they
might simply have been exploring the cove.</p>
<p>Eddie and Teena continued across the
rough beach. There was no one in sight at the
cove. As they walked, they picked up bright
shells which sprinkled the sand before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at these tracks, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said,
as she pointed down at deep grooves in the
sand. They were long and wide&mdash;the kind a
boat dragged up onto the beach would leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look fresh,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
have been here more than three or four hours,
or the tide would have wiped out the marks.
Wonder if it was the same two fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny that they would rent a boat to go
fishing,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;and then come in here
to the cove first. There aren&rsquo;t any sand crabs
to dig for bait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Eddie was thinking the same thing. Then he
saw footprints which led from the place where
the boat had been beached to the base of the
bluff rising above the cove. &ldquo;Now why would
they go to the foot of the bluff?&rdquo; Eddie said,
puzzled. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to see over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curiosity gripped him. He started following
the twin sets of footprints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d better go on if
we&rsquo;re going to visit Captain Daniels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t take long,&rdquo; Eddie called back
over his shoulder. Teena followed as he went
on toward the foot of the bluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kind of
path that zigzags up the bluff. I&rsquo;ve never noticed
that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much of a path,&rdquo; Teena said, looking
up the steeply winding trail. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t
know why anyone would want to use it to get
to this cove. It&rsquo;s much easier coming up the
beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But someone&rsquo;s been using it,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;See how the ground&rsquo;s stirred up. I can&rsquo;t figure
why anyone would want to land a boat in this
cove, then climb up and down that bluff before
going fishing. Can you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>&ldquo;Guess not,&rdquo; Teena admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be worth finding out,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up the path. I&rsquo;ve never been up top.
Might be something really worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;There used to be
some fishermen&rsquo;s shacks up top. But I don&rsquo;t
think anyone lives there any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for kicks, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; Eddie insisted,
starting up the winding path.</p>
<p>The dirt of the bluff was sandy and soft,
making hard climbing as it shifted and slid
underfoot. It took them several minutes to
climb the slanting palisade which was only
some seventy feet high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew,&rdquo; Teena said, after they had scrambled
up the last few feet. &ldquo;You sure get some
wild ideas, Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t answer. He stood looking
around. It was easy to see why so few people
were acquainted with that part of the coastline.
Although there were no trees of any size,
the rolling land which extended back from the
bluff&rsquo;s edge was covered with a dense tangle of
brush. Only a foolish person would try clawing
his way through it to get to the cove. The
beach route was the easy way, as Teena had
said.</p>
<p>Yet there was a faint path winding inland
from the top of the bluff. It disappeared
quickly into the brush. Fresh footprints indicated
that it had been used recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, why do you suppose anyone would
go that way?&rdquo; Eddie wondered aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to try it,&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;That brush would scratch my arms and legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it leads to that shack over there,&rdquo;
Eddie said, pointing.</p>
<p>He could see only the upper half of the
small building. Probably it had once been a
fisherman&rsquo;s house. The other fishermen&rsquo;s
buildings must have rotted away and fallen
into the weeds. The dampness of the seashore
could rot timbers out if they weren&rsquo;t kept up
properly. Even the structure that still stood
about two hundred yards away was badly
weather-beaten and without paint. The
shingles of the roof were crooked and partly
blown away, leaving gaping holes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/i04.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Come on, Eddie, let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;" width="500" height="704" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>Come on, Eddie, let&rsquo;s go back.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know why anyone would
want to go to that place,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Surely,
no one lives there. It&mdash;it almost looks haunted.
Come on, Eddie, let&rsquo;s go back. It&rsquo;s getting too
late to visit Captain Daniels, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get a good look at that shack,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; Teena insisted. &ldquo;I can see
enough of it from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t have a ready answer for wanting
to look more closely at the shack. He
couldn&rsquo;t even explain it in his own mind, let
alone give a good reason to Teena. Still, a lot
of things seemed to be in need of some explanation.
Why did the two men named
Simms and Benton come to the cove? Why
did their footprints lead up the bluff and disappear
into the brush? Did they lead to the
old shack? If so, why? And what about that
disappearing metal cylinder which Eddie had
seen in their boat last Saturday?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Maybe none of it meant a thing. Even if it
did, he certainly had no idea what it was.
Eddie shrugged. Sometimes his curiosity got
the best of him. Anyway, why bother Teena
with it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
<p>The following few days were sultry and hot.
Eddie stayed pretty close around home. He
saw little of his father. Between regular teaching
duties and the search still going on for the
stolen radioisotope, Mr. Taylor was very busy.
Each day he looked even more tired. Eddie
could only imagine how much the loss of the
secret radioactive substance bothered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Then, Friday, something happened which
set all Oceanview astir. The cause was a story
on the front page of the <i>Globe</i>. There wasn&rsquo;t
positive proof, but one of the Coast Guard
planes on regular patrol the previous Saturday
night had picked up a strange blip on its
radar screen. By the time the plane had circled
back to drop a flare and investigate, the image
on the radarscope had disappeared. Upon
dropping the flare, they had found nothing but
the smooth water of the ocean just outside the
entrance to Moon Bay.</p>
<p>The immediate belief was that the object
had been a submarine. Further, if it was a
submarine, it certainly had been a foreign
craft. The locations of all American submarines
were well charted and known by the
Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Finally, after a week of secret investigation
had revealed no proof of the object&rsquo;s actual
identity, the story was released to the newspapers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Eddie said that morning after breakfast,
as his father prepared to leave for school,
&ldquo;what would a foreign submarine be doing
around here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tough question to answer, Eddie,&rdquo;
Mr. Taylor said. &ldquo;And remember, what
showed up on the airplane&rsquo;s radar wasn&rsquo;t positively
identified as a submarine. It might have
been a whale. Or several whales, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newspaper doesn&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Eddie
said. &ldquo;Besides, no one&rsquo;s ever seen whales that
close in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what if it was a submarine?&rdquo; Eddie
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that it got off its course and
surfaced to try and get a bearing,&rdquo; his father
said. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, they probably were
considerably startled to find themselves so
close to shore, and dived immediately to avoid
discovery. It could happen. Submarines have
been known to scout off this coast. But usually
they are far out to sea in international waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they were picking up spies,&rdquo; Eddie
blurted. &ldquo;Or&mdash;or landing some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father looked at him sharply. &ldquo;What
kind of harum-scarum talk is that, Eddie?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Eddie swallowed uncomfortably. He wished
he hadn&rsquo;t said it. But he had been doing so
much thinking about the stolen radioisotope
and the missing blueprints from the Acme
Aviation Company that the words had leaped
from his mouth without his realizing it.</p>
<p>Before Eddie could think of an answer, his
father&rsquo;s face relaxed. &ldquo;Forget it, son,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You always have had a pretty active imagination.
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. Just
don&rsquo;t let it get away from you. Well, I&rsquo;d better
be leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;do you have a teacher at
school named Simms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simms?&rdquo; his father replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall
any Simms. What department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Teena and I
saw him out fishing a couple of times with a fat
man called Roy Benton. Then I thought I saw
Mr. Simms last week on the college campus.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have nearly two thousand enrolled
for summer courses, you know,&rdquo; his
father explained. &ldquo;Many of them are adults.
Teachers taking extra credit courses, or studying
for their masters&rsquo; degrees. I imagine a lot
of them go fishing on their days off. Any reason
I should know this Simms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Eddie said. He was a little
embarrassed at the questions he had asked. He
didn&rsquo;t really know why he had asked them.
Yet he felt that the various puzzling things
which had happened during the past weeks
might tie in together. He couldn&rsquo;t explain the
feeling, but it gained strength all of the time.</p>
<p>It was the reason, too, why he decided late
that afternoon to go and take a look at the
shack he and Teena had seen located back
from the top edge of the bluff the previous
week.</p>
<p>He decided not to ask Teena to go. She had
worried the other day about the brush scratching
her arms and legs. It would be simpler to
go by himself. He decided to take Sandy along
for company.</p>
<p>He stopped at Anderson&rsquo;s Landing long
enough to check with the owner about a boat
for him and Teena the next day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our agreement,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson
said, smiling. &ldquo;After all, you earned it. Don&rsquo;t
want you chasing any submarines with it,
though.&rdquo; The boatowner laughed. Apparently
people weren&rsquo;t taking the rumored submarine
sighting very seriously. Eddie supposed that,
as long as there was no proof, perhaps it was
just as well. Besides, even a foreign submarine
was not likely to cause any trouble. After all,
there was no war going on.</p>
<p>Still, Eddie couldn&rsquo;t shrug it off so lightly.
The tangle of strange happenings during the
past days upset him, and he didn&rsquo;t feel much
like joking; not when his father and Teena&rsquo;s
father were both in the thick of serious
trouble.</p>
<p>Eddie took his time getting to the cove.
Sandy chased back and forth into the surf after
bits of driftwood which he kept dropping at
Eddie&rsquo;s feet, and which Eddie threw back into
the water.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the cove, Eddie
wished he hadn&rsquo;t dawdled along so slowly. The
sun had dropped fast, and was already squashing
down against the horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Sandy,&rdquo; he said, starting for the
foot of the bluff. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started up the narrow winding trail.
Sandy scurried ahead and finally stood, panting
heavily, on top of the bluff, waiting for
Eddie.</p>
<p>The shack was still plainly visible in the
waning light. Eddie started along the path. In
most places it could hardly be called a path,
except that there were dim tracks to follow.
The heavy growth of brush and weeds tore at
his clothes. He kept his arms tucked in close
to his body to keep from getting scratched.
Sandy had no difficulty whatsoever in racing
back and forth through the thick scrubby
growth. All of his running had tired the cocker
spaniel enough that he wasn&rsquo;t yipping and
barking as he so often did.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes Eddie was to be very
thankful for that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>As he had suspected, the faint trail ended at
the door of the old abandoned fisherman&rsquo;s
shack. In the eerie light of dusk, Eddie remembered
Teena saying that it looked almost
haunted. It certainly did. Broken shutters
dangled from boarded-up windows. Gaping
holes in the roof yawned at the darkening sky.
The warped and twisted wooden siding made
the whole structure look as though it were
about to cave in.</p>
<p>Eddie approached the shack cautiously. He
figured his curiosity would be satisfied if he
took just one look inside.</p>
<p>His hand was poised over the latch on the
door when a slight scratching sound from inside
froze it in mid-air. It sounded like someone
scratching a match.</p>
<p>Even as he stood there with sudden fear
prickling along his spine, a small flare of light
seeped through one of the cracks between the
warped boards of the door. It <i>was</i> a match!
Eddie sucked in his breath and drew back. His
first thought was to turn and run.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>On second thought, however, he paused.
Perhaps hoboes now and then used the abandoned
shack for sleeping quarters. It couldn&rsquo;t
be very comfortable, but it would be better
than sleeping outside in the damp ocean air.
Although Eddie had no desire to meet any
hobo, it was hardly reason to run away in a
panic.</p>
<p>Without making any sound, and glad that
Sandy was off exploring in the brush, Eddie
sought one of the larger cracks in the door.
Leaning toward it, he put one eye to the crack.</p>
<p>It was then that Eddie&rsquo;s fear took a firm grip
on him. A small candle burned on an empty
fruit crate standing in the middle of the
shack&rsquo;s single room. In one corner was an old
double bunk, empty now of mattresses or bedding.
A couple of rickety chairs and a bench
completed what furniture was inside the
shack.</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s eye was attracted by the glint of
candlelight upon metal. Squinting through
the crack, he was able to make out the form of
the reflecting object. It was one of those metal
tubes&mdash;like the one he had noticed in the bottom
of the strangers&rsquo; rowboat that day at the
cove. On the floor was a square battery camp
lantern such as hunters often use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>There was one person in the room. He sat
on the small bench. His back was partly turned
toward Eddie. He appeared to be studying
some kind of a paper, although Eddie could
see only a small corner of it.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the man, although
his face was turned away. It was the chubby
fellow named Roy Benton.</p>
<p>There was nothing more to see. Eddie
backed carefully away from the door. A few
yards away, he turned and scrambled back
along the darkening path toward the cove, as
Sandy came crashing through the brush to
meet him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
<p>A lot of trouble might have been saved if
things had worked out as Eddie had planned.
And, yet, if they had, the mystery of the missing
blueprints and the stolen radioisotope
might never have been cleared up.</p>
<p>Hurrying home through the darkness, Eddie
went over in his mind the story he would
tell his father. Perhaps it didn&rsquo;t mean a thing.
Perhaps his imagination simply was running
wild, as his father had hinted. He had to admit
to himself that he was prone to build
rather normal incidents into deep mysteries.
He had always been that way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Even allowing for that, however, Eddie still
believed there was a strong possibility that the
events of the past weeks might tie in with the
stolen radioisotope; perhaps even with the
missing blueprints from Acme Aviation.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of those events the
figures of the two men&mdash;Simms and Roy Benton&mdash;kept
looming up in his mind. Anyway,
he thought he should tell his father about it
and let him decide whether there could be any
possible connection.</p>
<p>It was not, however, to be that way. Upon
arriving home well after dark, Eddie found his
mother both irked and worried over his late
return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even ask me if you could go,&rdquo;
she scolded. &ldquo;And you know better than to be
getting home at this late hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mom,&rdquo; Eddie said meekly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know I would be gone so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Taylor turned from the stove where
she was warming his dinner. &ldquo;After you eat,&rdquo;
she said firmly, &ldquo;I want you to go right to bed.
No television.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>It was a mild enough punishment, Eddie
thought, and didn&rsquo;t argue. His father would
not have been so lenient. He looked around.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father phoned a while ago,&rdquo; his
mother explained. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be home late. Feed
Sandy now; then wash up for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie opened a can of dog food, went outside,
and spooned half of it into Sandy&rsquo;s dish.
Capping the can with a plastic cover, he put it
in the refrigerator, then went to wash.</p>
<p>After dinner he kissed his mother good
night and went straight to his room. He lay in
bed, going over in his mind the recent events.
He listened for his father&rsquo;s arrival. He had
hoped somehow to evade his early-bedtime
punishment long enough to tell his story to his
father. But he hadn&rsquo;t counted on his tiredness.
He fell fast asleep long before his father came
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>The sound of the car backing out of the
driveway awakened Eddie the following morning.
He washed and dressed quickly. Perhaps
his mother had gone to do a bit of early shopping.
It was Saturday. Probably his father
would be home for the day. Now might be
Eddie&rsquo;s best chance to tell him what had been
running through his mind.</p>
<p>Hurrying into the kitchen, he found his
mother at the dinette table having a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Mom. Where&rsquo;s Dad?&rdquo; Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just drove out, Eddie,&rdquo; his mother said.
&ldquo;He had to get over to school early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturdays haven&rsquo;t been very restful for
your father lately, have they?&rdquo; his mother said.
&ldquo;He has an appointment with some people
from Washington D.C. this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the stolen radioisotope?&rdquo; Eddie
wondered aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be,&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
say, and I didn&rsquo;t ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t ask?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; his mother said firmly, &ldquo;the theft
of that isotope is pretty serious business. Your
father is handling it the best he can. He&rsquo;ll tell
us what he wants us to know. It is not our part
to be asking questions. You try to remember
that, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t say anything. He knew his
mother was right. He was greatly disappointed,
though, that he hadn&rsquo;t had the chance
to talk to his father.</p>
<p>Eddie was finishing breakfast when Teena
telephoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to Cedar Point today, aren&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so,&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guess so? But Mr. Anderson is holding
a boat for us. This is Saturday, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we should get started,&rdquo; Teena insisted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some row out to Cedar Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
to ask Mom.&rdquo; He turned and explained their
plans to his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Eddie,&rdquo; Mrs. Taylor said.
&ldquo;But no getting home late like yesterday, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mom,&rdquo; Eddie promised.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll start early, and get back early.&rdquo; Then
he spoke to Teena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right over,&rdquo; Teena replied, &ldquo;soon as
I make us a little picnic lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie got the Geiger counter out of the
closet. He told his mother how he had been
wanting to try it out on Cedar Point. He told
her about the dream he had had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess you never can tell,&rdquo; Mrs.
Taylor said. &ldquo;According to your father,
uranium ore often shows up in most unlikely
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cedar Point isn&rsquo;t so unlikely, Mom,&rdquo;
Eddie said. &ldquo;There are lots of rock formations
out there. Uranium ore is usually located
where there are plenty of rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Teena arrived Eddie was all set to
leave. He wore swimming trunks under his
blue jeans. Teena said she also had her bathing
suit on in case they had to swim home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you children be careful,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s
mother cautioned. &ldquo;The bay&rsquo;s usually nice and
smooth, but it can get pretty choppy. If it does,
you head straight for shore, understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will, Mrs. Taylor,&rdquo; Teena promised.</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s mother smiled. &ldquo;Be back no later
than four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; she said to Eddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have a watch, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell by the sun,&rdquo; he said proudly, then
added, &ldquo;pretty close, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie carried the Geiger counter and
Teena the picnic lunch as they started toward
Anderson&rsquo;s Landing.</p>
<p>Although it was a nice sunny day for fishing,
there were still several rowboats tied up
at the landing. Mr. Anderson was in his little
office at the foot of the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Saved
you a nice light pair of oars, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Anderson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take boat Number Eighteen,&rdquo; the owner
said. &ldquo;She rides high and is leakproof. What&rsquo;s
that gadget you&rsquo;ve got there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Geiger counter, Mr. Anderson,&rdquo;
Eddie said. &ldquo;We hope we&rsquo;ll find some signs of
uranium out on Cedar Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That the stuff you make atom bombs of?&rdquo;
Mr. Anderson said, with a note of disapproval
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can make bombs of it,&rdquo; Eddie admitted,
&ldquo;but nowadays scientists are more interested
in running machinery and curing
diseases with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the kind of thing I like to hear,&rdquo;
Mr. Anderson said, smiling. &ldquo;In that case,
good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon, with Eddie at the oars, they started
toward distant Cedar Point. Eddie set the
course in a line which cut at an angle across
the bay. As they were crossing the submerged
sand bar, Teena pointed shoreward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie, look,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Resting on the oars and following the direction
of Teena&rsquo;s finger, Eddie saw that they
were directly offshore from the cove. He also
saw the orange-and-white rowboat pulled up
onto the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Of even more importance, he saw two men
making their way carefully down the narrow
trail which zigzagged down the face of the
bluff. Even from the distance, Eddie saw that
one man was tall and thin, the other short and
fat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those two men!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But don&rsquo;t get so excited,&rdquo;
Teena said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re probably just coming
out fishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming from where?&rdquo; Eddie asked. He
knew there was only one place to come from&mdash;the
shack. Then he remembered that Teena
didn&rsquo;t know about his visit to the shack yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get away
from here before they come out to fish over
this sand bar. They sure would think we were
spying on them if they found us out here. I
hope they don&rsquo;t see us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To far away for them to tell who we are,&rdquo;
Eddie assured, sharing Teena&rsquo;s dislike of
meeting the two men again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Eddie started to turn back to rowing, when
the flash of sun on metal caught his eye. He
knew at once that one of the men was carrying
that metal cylinder which he had seen yesterday
evening in the shack, and which he had
puzzled over so long. He would like to have
stayed and gotten another look at it; that is, if
the two men were coming out to fish over the
sand bar again. Yet Teena&rsquo;s warning about
getting away seemed the wiser move. Eddie
bent to the oars.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later he guided the boat
onto the narrow beach at Cedar Point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; he said, mopping the sweat from
his forehead. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of rowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a swell ride, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll row back if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a girl,&rdquo; Eddie said importantly,
which seemed to close the subject about Teena
doing the rowing. But Teena did help him
drag the boat up onto the beach beyond the
high-water mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now to find some uranium,&rdquo; Eddie said,
picking up the Geiger counter. Before starting
inland to explore the point, however, he
shaded his eyes and looked back across the bay.
In the far distance he could barely make out
Anderson&rsquo;s Landing. Quite a few boats dotted
the bay in between. Directly in line between
Cedar Point and Anderson&rsquo;s Landing was the
light strip of water marking the submerged
sand bar. There was only one boat over the
sand bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two fellows are fishing in that same
place again today,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
seem to learn, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not worry about them,&rdquo; Teena said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start prospecting. We promised to be
home by four. It&rsquo;s a long trip back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind-swept point offered difficult hiking.
Fallen trees and tangles of underbrush
slowed their progress. They had to keep on
the lookout for poison ivy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If leaves there are three, leave it be,&rdquo; Eddie
said, remembering the familiar warning. They
gave wide berth to the irritating vine whenever
they saw it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>Eddie left the Geiger counter switched on
much of the time. The way led over the rocks.
There was no way of telling, except by the
Geiger counter, if any of the rocks were radioactive.
The results, however, were quite discouraging.
Except for the faint background
count, the Geiger counter gave no sign of there
being any uranium-bearing ore on Cedar
Point.</p>
<p>After a tiring hour and a half of hard climbing
over and around the outcroppings, Teena
suggested they stop and eat their picnic lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might as well,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Sure doesn&rsquo;t
look like we&rsquo;re going to find anything out here.
Lot of trouble for nothing, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Eddie,&rdquo; Teena disagreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
having fun aren&rsquo;t we? After all, you&rsquo;re supposed
to have fun during vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be better, though, to have fun and find
some uranium, too,&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>Teena laughed. &ldquo;You sure do want everything,&rdquo;
she remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Eddie switched off the Geiger counter.
They found some shade under a wind-twisted
oak and ate their lunch. Eddie glanced at the
sun. &ldquo;It must be one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guess
we&rsquo;d better be starting back. The water will
be a little choppier than this morning. Won&rsquo;t
be so easy to row. I don&rsquo;t want to get home late,
or my mom will scalp me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ve
done enough prospecting out here to know
there&rsquo;s no uranium around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way back to the boat Eddie tried out
the Geiger counter in a couple of places they
had missed. The results were the same&mdash;negative.
He put the Geiger counter into the bottom
of the boat, pushed the boat into the
water, and jumped in after Teena.</p>
<p>A slight breeze angling in over the bow
made rowing difficult. Less than halfway across
the bay, Eddie&rsquo;s arms and shoulders began to
ache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said from her seat in the
stern, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t I sit there beside you and
row with one of the oars? We&rsquo;ve done it before.
Just give me a little time to get the swing
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; Eddie said tiredly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Teena moved up beside him on the wide
center seat and took the starboard oar handle
in both hands. After a couple minutes of
splashing and going in circles, they settled
down to pulling together smoothly and evenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, this is the best deal,&rdquo; Eddie admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;even girls can be
some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie smiled. As they were approaching the
near end of the under water sand bar, he
craned his neck around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those two men have gone,
so we won&rsquo;t run across them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept pulling together. The water
turned light in color as the sun reflected off the
yellowish sand lying a scant ten feet beneath
the surface.</p>
<p>Suddenly Teena stopped rowing. &ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; Eddie asked, resting on his
oar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That clicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clicking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heard it then, almost beneath the seat.
He glanced down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yipes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I forgot to
switch off the Geiger counter before I put it in
the boat. Boy, if the battery is weak, Dad&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached toward the switch. His hand
stopped in mid-air. The needle of the radioactivity
gauge was quivering far over to the
right, and the clicking which had attracted
Teena&rsquo;s attention was much louder and faster
than the normal background count.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teena! There&mdash;there&rsquo;s radioactivity
around here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Maybe underneath the water. Maybe
on the sand bar. This is a sensitive Geiger
counter. It could pick it up all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, the clicking&rsquo;s getting weak again,&rdquo;
Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be drifting away from whatever is
causing it,&rdquo; Eddie said. He moved the Geiger
counter up onto the seat between them. He
put the earphones on. &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s kind of circle
around here and try to pick it up again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>With nothing but a broad expanse of water
and no marker to guide them, trying to locate
the spot where the Geiger counter had sputtered
to life was anything but easy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie, I think we&rsquo;re getting farther away
all the time,&rdquo; Teena said ten minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we don&rsquo;t find it now we might never
find it again,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;Just a little more.
Pull easy on your oar. We&rsquo;ll circle to the left
and&mdash;Hey, there it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rapid clicking through the headset
filled his ears. &ldquo;Hold &rsquo;er steady,&rdquo; he said. He
crawled quickly to the bow of the boat, lifted
the heavy concrete anchor over the gunwale,
and eased it down onto the sand bar with the
Manila line attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There. We won&rsquo;t lose it now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lose what, Eddie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s making the Geiger counter act
up,&rdquo; Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would be an awful wet place to have
to mine for uranium,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be done,&rdquo; Eddie insisted. &ldquo;Boy,
we must be right over it. Listen to those clicks.
And look at that needle jump around.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Teena looked over the side. &ldquo;It looks to me
like plain old yellow sand down there,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be some uranium-bearing rock under
it,&rdquo; Eddie said. He leaned over his side of
the boat. Although the sand bar was not far
below, the water was somewhat murky, and
the ripples on the surface made it difficult to
see anything on the bottom. &ldquo;Might be a tough
job getting at it, all right, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the words died in Eddie&rsquo;s throat,
as a glint of metal flashed in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teena, there&mdash;there&rsquo;s something down on
the sand bar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something bright. Like metal.&rdquo; Eddie put
his face as close to the water as he could without
falling out of the boat. &ldquo;I can see it now!&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about two feet long. Two
or three inches thick. It looks round, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie!&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;The metal tube you
saw that day in the rowboat. You know, the day
we came across those two men at the cove. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Eddie said, for the thought
already had sprung into his mind.</p>
<p>Now two other thoughts crowded in behind
it. Both were puzzling thoughts which left his
mind reeling.</p>
<p>What was the metal tube doing there below
on the sand bar? Why, above all things, was it
sending out radioactive rays?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER NINE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;what are you going to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Eddie had pulled off his shoes and
T shirt. He slipped off his blue jeans, and
stood in his bathing trunks ready to dive overboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going down and get that thing,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s mighty crazy about all this,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Teena agreed. &ldquo;But Eddie,
isn&rsquo;t it dangerous? If that thing&rsquo;s radioactive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s not that radioactive,&rdquo; Eddie said.
&ldquo;Those two men handled it all right. It&rsquo;s some
special kind of a tube. I&rsquo;m going to take it to
my dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; Eddie repeated impatiently. &ldquo;Because
it must have something to do with that
stolen radioisotope, that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t need to get sore at me,&rdquo;
Teena scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, Teena,&rdquo; Eddie said, calming
down. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to take the chance of
leaving the thing out here and maybe not
being able to find it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure it won&rsquo;t hurt you?&rdquo; Teena asked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m real sure,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that
Geiger counter act up a lot worse over a small
sample of uranium ore. Don&rsquo;t worry. If it was
really hot with radiation, those two men
wouldn&rsquo;t have been handling it either. Dad
said that whoever stole the isotope would be an
expert on knowing how to handle it safely. I&rsquo;ll
be right back.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The cylinder was simple to locate.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Eddie slipped over the side and into the
water. He took a breath, nosed over, and
kicked downward. It was a shallow dive compared
to some he had made while skin diving
for lobster. He stroked easily down to the sand
bar. The bright metal cylinder was simple to
locate even in the murky water. He grabbed it
with his left hand and swam back to the surface.</p>
<p>Teena took it from him and laid it in the
bottom of the boat. Then she helped him
climb in over the stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like anything very special,
does it?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I thought it was for holding a
jointed trout rod,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;but watch
this.&rdquo; He switched on the Geiger counter and
held the probe near the metal tube. The earphones
began to sputter with continuous
clicks. The indicator on the dial jumped far
forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cinch there&rsquo;s some radioactive stuff
inside,&rdquo; Eddie assured. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. I&rsquo;ve got to
take this to my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they drew within a quarter of a mile of
Anderson&rsquo;s Landing, Teena said, &ldquo;Eddie,
what if those two men should be around the
boat dock and see us with this tube?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie looked over his shoulder. He saw only
one person on the landing. That would probably
be Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve already turned in their
boat and gone on home,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;but just
to be safe, we&rsquo;ll do this.&rdquo; He picked up his blue
jeans which he had left wadded up in the
bottom of the boat, as he hadn&rsquo;t wanted to put
them back on over his wet trunks. He pushed
the metal tube into one of the empty legs.
Then he wrapped the excess material around
it. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, satisfied, &ldquo;no one can see
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson came out to meet them as
they eased the rowboat gently up to the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how did it go?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Find any
atoms?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Eddie smiled. &ldquo;Everything is made of atoms,
Mr. Anderson,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We were looking
for uranium. That&rsquo;s a special kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a special, all right,&rdquo; the boat-owner
agreed, &ldquo;the way it can blow things to
smithereens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t argue, but he wished people
would stop thinking that all radioactive materials
were used to blow things up. He supposed,
however, that since the atomic bombs
were what really started what came to be called
the Atomic Age, it would take some time to
educate the public to the fact that atomic
power was a much greater builder than a destroyer.
Anyway, at the moment he didn&rsquo;t want
to get into a long discussion about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t find any uranium, Mr. Anderson,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we had a swell trip,&rdquo; Teena put in.
&ldquo;Thanks for letting us use the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You earned it,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson reminded
them. &ldquo;By the way, those two fellows who have
been fishing over the sand bar came in a while
ago. Didn&rsquo;t catch a thing. Sure a stubborn pair,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they just don&rsquo;t like to clean fish,&rdquo;
Eddie said. But he was glad Mr. Anderson had
mentioned the men. It added evidence to his
belief that they weren&rsquo;t the least bit interested
in fishing, anyway.</p>
<p>After cleaning up the boat, he and Teena
started along the dock. Eddie carried the metal
tube rolled up in his blue jeans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you want a boat,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson
said, as they stepped off the dock and started
across the beach toward home, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re always
welcome to earn it the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Eddie called back. &ldquo;We may
need one again before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a little past three o&rsquo;clock when they
reached Eddie&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly made it in good time,&rdquo; his
mother said. &ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at Cedar Point,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;But,
Mom, we found something else. Where&rsquo;s
Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not home from school yet,&rdquo; his
mother said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you have wrapped
up in your jeans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Eddie told her quickly, without going into
all of the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it has something to do with
the stolen radioisotope?&rdquo; his mother asked in
disbelief, when he had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mom,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;But
why would it be radioactive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t opened it, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s sealed tight,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
thought Dad should do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. You run it over to school and
find your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teena spoke up for the first time. &ldquo;Eddie,
if that tube really belongs out there and we
took it, we&mdash;we might get in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belongs out there?&rdquo; Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the Coast Guard is using it for
some kind of a test or something,&rdquo; Teena said.</p>
<p>That was a possibility which hadn&rsquo;t occurred
to Eddie, yet he quickly dismissed it
from his mind. The two men who had planted
it out on the sand bar certainly had nothing to
do with the Coast Guard or anything like that.
Nor would it have been in the shack yesterday
evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;m
going to take it over for Dad to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call him and tell him you&rsquo;re on your
way,&rdquo; his mother said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to go along, Teena?&rdquo; Eddie
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a question,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Sure, I
want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; his mother reminded him, &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t go over to school in your swim trunks. Go
slip on some denims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie hurried to his room and put on some
freshly laundered denims. Then, leaving the
metal tube still wrapped in the blue jeans, he
and Teena started down the street toward the
college campus.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor was waiting for them in front of
the nuclear-science building. He seemed
strangely excited. Eddie wondered what his
mother had said over the telephone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take it, son,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said,
reaching out for the blue jeans in which the
metal cylinder was wrapped. He turned to go
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we come with you, Dad?&rdquo; Eddie asked
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; his father said over
his shoulder. &ldquo;Come along. If this is anything
like your mother said, there&rsquo;ll be a lot of questions
to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s father led them through his office
and on into a dressing room where they pulled
on specially treated white coveralls, gloves,
and hoods which fitted over their heads. Each
hood had a small glass window for looking out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just an extra precaution,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father
said. &ldquo;Really not necessary, but we simply
don&rsquo;t take any chances with possible stray radiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on into the large laboratory.
Eddie had been there before. The sight of the
fantastically shaped apparatus used in various
atomic-research tests always excited him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>There were several men in the room. Each
was dressed in white coverall-type protective
suits similar to those he and Teena and Mr.
Taylor wore.</p>
<p>In the center of the laboratory stood a
square booth with thick walls and a glass
window in the front wall. Eddie knew the
walls were lead-lined, and the glass was a thick,
specially treated type. All experiments which
were the least bit hazardous were conducted
inside of that six-by-six-foot booth. The radioactive
materials were handled remotely by a
strange steel-fingered device operated by a
man who stood safely outside of the booth.
Absolutely no chances were taken in the handling
of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s father inspected the tube closely, as
he went toward one of the many complex devices
that filled the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a careful job of machining on this
tube,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Surely not the work of amateurs.
Seems to be a lead alloy of some kind.
Probably worked out in thickness and amount
of lead in the alloy so as to allow just the right
amount of radioactive rays to leak through
without being dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>He flicked several switches and turned
various knobs on the instrument under which
he had placed the tube. Eddie watched dial
needles quiver and lights flash, wishing he
knew what they meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; his father said, turning off the
machine, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re exactly right. There&rsquo;s radioactivity
inside that tube. Plenty of it, I imagine.
Yet, only enough of it is allowed to
leak out to furnish a tracer. It was a regular
beacon leading you right to it with your
Geiger counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, you mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hold the questions a while, Eddie,&rdquo;
Mr. Taylor interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a few tests
to run on this first. There are some things we
need to find out for sure.&rdquo; He called to one of
the young men working at the far side of the
room. They talked for a few moments while
the laboratory worker inspected the cylinder
closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Then he took it inside the shielded booth
and laid it on the table beneath the strange
contraption with the protruding metal arms
and pincers. Several other pieces of testing apparatus
were placed on the table. Then he
came back outside, closing the door carefully
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Taylor,&rdquo; the young technician
said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see what we can do with
it.&rdquo; He slipped his hands into the grips which
operated the metal fingers on the far side of
the thick, protective glass through which they
watched.</p>
<p>Eddie and Teena looked on fascinated as,
controlled from outside, the mechanical
clamps on the metal arms inside picked up
the tube. Then wrenchlike metal fingers
wrapped around one sealed end. After much
twisting and prying, the tight fitted cap came
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far, so good,&rdquo; the young scientist said.
&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s inside.&rdquo; He moved his
own hands and the mechanical fingers inside
tipped the tube on its end. A small black
capsule slid out onto the table. It was about
the size of a dime-store beanshooter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>The metal fingers kept working until
the cap sealing the small black capsule was
removed. When it was tipped on end a yellowish
powder trickled out into a small bowl
which had been placed on the table inside.</p>
<p>The metal fingers continued working. They
placed the small bowl with the yellow contents
under one instrument after another.
Knobs were turned and readings were jotted
down. After the final test was made, Eddie&rsquo;s
father studied the results carefully. He compared
them with the formulas on a piece of
paper he had brought from his office.</p>
<p>While waiting silently, Eddie&rsquo;s gaze went
back to the large uncapped silver-gray cylinder
still lying inside on the table. What appeared
to be a corner of a sheet of paper jutted
slightly out of the open end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like there&rsquo;s something else inside of
that tube,&rdquo; he said to the young technician
beside him. Talking beneath his hood muffled
his words, yet the scientist seemed to have no
trouble understanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;By George, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said. He
reached once more for the proper grip rings
and levers to operate the robot fingers inside.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tipped the tube so the open end was
down, then shook it. A large piece of rolled-up
paper dropped out. As it fell to the table, it
unrolled part way&mdash;enough, at least, for
Eddie to see the blue color of its inside surface.
He also saw the white markings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blueprints!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>At the word, his father looked up from his
own busy figuring. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They sure are blueprints. You kids certainly
hit upon something big. Mighty big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Dad?&rdquo; Eddie wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; his father said
firmly. &ldquo;The material that came out of the
small black capsule inside of that tube is a part
of the stolen radioisotope. It&rsquo;s mixed in with
some other material to weaken its power. But
I&rsquo;m certain the radioactivity comes from small
amounts of our isotope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve found the stolen isotope!&rdquo;
Eddie exclaimed. Although the idea had occurred
to him before, hearing the proof of it
was no less startling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only part of it,&rdquo; his father reminded him.
Then he turned toward Teena. &ldquo;Unless I miss
my guess, those blueprints are some of the
ones missing from Acme Aircraft Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed sheer fantasy, like something
that might happen in a restless dream after
eating too much ice cream and lobster salad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, kids,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor prompted,
leading them back toward his office. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a lot to be done. And unless I miss my guess, it
must be done quickly&mdash;or we might be too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER TEN</h2>
<p>Once back inside of his office, Mr. Taylor
motioned for Eddie and Teena to be seated.
Then he picked up the phone and made two
quick calls. They also must have been local
calls, Eddie thought, for within five minutes
two men hurried into the office. Both were
dressed in normal summer business clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s father introduced the dark-haired
one in the light-tan suit as Mr. Paul Evans
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
other man was tall, light-haired, and blue-eyed.
His name was Walter Jamison. He was
from the Drake Ridge atomic reactor. Eddie&rsquo;s
father didn&rsquo;t explain what either man was
doing there, but Eddie had no doubts that
their main interest was recovery of the stolen
radioisotope. Probably they had been around
the Oceanview College campus ever since the
theft had taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Eddie,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said after
the two men sat down. &ldquo;Start from the beginning
and give us the whole story. Don&rsquo;t leave
anything out. Teena, you see that he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie didn&rsquo;t know exactly what his father
meant by the whole story. But he started with
the day when he and Teena had come upon
the two men at the cove. He told about their
somewhat strange actions, and the puzzling
sight of the sealed metal tube lying in the
bottom of the rowboat. He mentioned how
the men had not had it with them when they
returned the boat to Anderson&rsquo;s Landing a
while later.</p>
<p>He told about seeing the men fishing out
over the sand bar the Saturday after that, and
again today.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Then, to Teena&rsquo;s surprise, he brought in
yesterday&rsquo;s lone hike out to the cove. He told
of his curiosity over the tracks leading to the
abandoned fisherman&rsquo;s shack set back from
the top of the bluff, and how he had been
greatly surprised, at peeking through the crack
in the door, to see the chubby man named
Roy Benton inside, as well as a bright metal
cylinder&mdash;like the one they had just taken
apart in the laboratory&mdash;standing in a corner
of the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably it was the same tube you just
took apart,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;When Teena and I
were rowing out to Cedar Point this morning,
we saw the two men coming down the bluff
carrying something shiny. Later, looking back
from Cedar Point, we saw them anchored over
the sand bar. Probably over the same place we
found the cylinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It figures,&rdquo; Mr. Evans, the FBI man said.
&ldquo;For the sake of argument, let&rsquo;s say the two
men are spies. Could be even more than two
here at the college or working at Acme Aircraft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spies!&rdquo; Teena gasped in disbelief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re both hiding at the shack,&rdquo;
Eddie said excitedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go arrest
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;Arresting
them isn&rsquo;t nearly so important as finding out
where the remainder of the radioisotope is
hidden. Getting hold of the rest of those missing
blueprints also is much more important
than arresting two men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; Mr. Jamison added, &ldquo;arresting
them too early might tip off the whole operation,
and everyone would run for cover before
we could pin anything down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Teena&rsquo;s father came hurrying into
the office. &ldquo;Sorry I couldn&rsquo;t get here sooner,
Steve,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Taylor, &ldquo;but we were
trying to locate another very important set of
blueprints. More secret guidance-system parts.
I absolutely can&rsquo;t figure how those blueprints
can keep disappearing, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s father held out the rolled-up blueprints
which had been inside the metal tube.
&ldquo;These wouldn&rsquo;t happen to be the ones, would
they, Tom?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>One glance, and Mr. Ross&rsquo;s face took on
an expression of mixed pleasure and amazement.
&ldquo;They certainly are!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;But how&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The FBI man interrupted. He brought
Teena&rsquo;s father up to date on the story thus
far. Mr. Ross looked over toward Teena and
Eddie. As pleased as he seemed over the recovery
of at least part of the missing blueprints,
he appeared even more concerned
over something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had had any idea that you two were
getting mixed up in anything like this,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have insisted that you stay home and
play scrabble or checkers or something safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t mixed up in anything,
Mr. Ross,&rdquo; Eddie said quickly. &ldquo;At least, we
sure didn&rsquo;t know we were, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; the FBI man cut in, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;d
better get down to cases. We may not have
much time to solve this problem. Let&rsquo;s see
what we have to go on thus far. Then we&rsquo;ll
try to plan our next move.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Eddie listened as Mr. Evans reviewed the
situation point by point. Two men&mdash;the one
called Simms and the other known as Roy
Benton&mdash;were involved in stealing the blueprints
and the radioisotope. Mr. Evans didn&rsquo;t
seem at all worried about capturing them
when the time was ripe. On each of the last
three Saturdays, including today, Eddie and
Teena had seen them fishing, or pretending
to be fishing, over the sand bar in Moon Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might assume, then,&rdquo; the FBI man
said, &ldquo;that on the past two Saturdays the men&rsquo;s
real purpose for going out in the boat was to
drop other metal tubes overboard. Other tubes
similar to this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said, &ldquo;the
first time Eddie and Teena saw them was the
very Saturday after the isotope was stolen from
the college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Mr. Jamison said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; the FBI man picked up the line of
thought, &ldquo;the question is why the men dropped
the metal tubes out on the sand bar. It&rsquo;s
a fairly safe bet that each tube contained a
little of the radioactive material, plus other
blueprints. Let&rsquo;s assume that the reason behind
the whole thing is to smuggle the blueprints
out of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would go for the isotope, too,&rdquo; the
man from Drake Ridge said. &ldquo;It was a new
secret isotope, you know. Various foreign
governments would like to get their hands
on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men didn&rsquo;t talk like foreigners,&rdquo;
Eddie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, they wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said.
&ldquo;Might not even be foreigners. Unfortunately,
there are a few greedy people who will do
almost anything for money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even spy?&rdquo; Teena said, aghast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even spy,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;But what we
need to find out is how anyone is managing to
smuggle the stuff out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably by boat,&rdquo; Mr. Jamison said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Coast Guard keeps close tabs on all
boating,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;And the bay&rsquo;s too
shallow to allow ocean-going ships inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>A thought sprang into Eddie&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Mr.
Evans,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I found a rubber strap on
the beach last week. It looked like a strap
broken off a swim fin or something like that.
It&mdash;it has some foreign printing on it. I have
it at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His announcement had an immediate effect.
&ldquo;That should give us a real clue,&rdquo; the FBI
man said quickly. &ldquo;It makes sense, too, that
the cylinders would be recovered by skin
divers. Perhaps foreign divers similar to our
own frogmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have to be done after dark,&rdquo; Mr.
Ross said. &ldquo;Otherwise they would be seen.
And how could anyone locate a small cylinder
like that under ten feet of water at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can answer that,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father
said. &ldquo;In fact, Eddie and Teena found that
answer. It could be located with a Geiger
counter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; the FBI man agreed. &ldquo;For instance,
they could use a rubber boat to sneak
in under cover of darkness. They would know
the approximate location of the cylinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;By some established plan. Probably by
triangulation. They could use the lighthouse
for one reference point. Perhaps some other
signal light on shore would give them a second
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly, Eddie told him about seeing the
heavy-duty battery lantern in the shack. &ldquo;They
might use it for a signal light,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possible,&rdquo; Mr. Evans agreed. &ldquo;Anyway,
a little quick figuring would locate the
spot on the sand bar where the men had
dropped the cylinder. A Geiger counter could
pinpoint it quickly. The diver would recover
the cylinder, climb into his rubber boat, and
paddle back out&mdash;&rdquo; His words dwindled away
to thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paddle back out to what?&rdquo; The man from
Drake Ridge voiced the thought that was in
all their minds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Eddie wondered if the same answer that immediately
occurred to him was shared by the
others. Although soon after the article had
appeared in the Oceanview newspapers most
readers had discarded it as nothing more than
an unfounded rumor, Eddie had never quite
forgotten it. Nor had the Coast Guard officially
withdrawn its belief of what had been sighted
by its radar equipment that Saturday night
two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Now there seemed no argument. It was, in
fact, the only logical method by which the
isotope and the plans could be smuggled away
without detection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The submarine!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
<p>The parts of the mysterious jigsaw puzzle had
begun to fit into a rough pattern, with Eddie
and Teena furnishing most of the key pieces.
Mr. Evans glanced at his wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now a quarter after five,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
supposed submarine sighting took place on a
Saturday night two weeks ago. That same day
Eddie and Teena saw the men out over the
sand bar. They saw them again last Saturday.
Probably another pickup took place that
night. It&rsquo;s logical, therefore, to assume that
the third pickup is scheduled for tonight. That
doesn&rsquo;t give us much time to set our trap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boss,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said. &ldquo;You
tell us what you want us to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father said anxiously.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t overemphasize how important
it is that those blueprints don&rsquo;t get out of this
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First I have several urgent phone calls to
make,&rdquo; the FBI man said quickly. &ldquo;Must get
the wheels turning at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a phone in the empty office next
door,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor volunteered. &ldquo;Help yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the federal investigator was in the
next room telephoning, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Ross,
and the man from Drake Ridge talked over
what they knew so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently what we have to go on,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s
father said, &ldquo;are some assorted guesses,
none of which may prove to be positive facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, guesses will have to do for the moment,&rdquo;
Mr. Ross said. &ldquo;We have to have a
starting point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor agreed, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
what we have. Two men seem responsible for
both the stolen isotope and the missing blueprints.
Eddie and Teena both saw the tall one
called Simms on the college campus about a
week ago. He must be familiar with our
atomic-research department in order to know
of the delivery, and to plan a method for stealing
the isotope. In that case, he shouldn&rsquo;t be
difficult to trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; Eddie said suddenly, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t
everyone who works around the atomic lab
have an identification badge with his picture
on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right,&rdquo; his father said,
getting up quickly. &ldquo;And we have duplicates
of the pictures right here in our files.&rdquo; He
pulled a thick album from a steel drawer. He
thumbed through to the &lsquo;S&rsquo; section and opened
it in front of Teena and Eddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; Eddie said, pointing almost
immediately to the picture of the thin-faced
man. His name was listed as Harvey Simms.
Underneath the photo the man&rsquo;s job title was
typed in a single word&mdash;Custodian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I recognize him,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him working around. A quiet person.
The kind you hardly notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way he would want it to be,&rdquo;
Mr. Ross said.</p>
<p>Teena and Eddie went through the entire
book of pictures without recognizing any as
the man called Roy Benton. Mr. Ross picked
up the telephone and called the Acme Aircraft
Company personnel department. He
gave Roy Benton&rsquo;s name and the description
Eddie and Teena had furnished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See if you can get a line on such a person,&rdquo;
Mr. Ross instructed over the telephone. &ldquo;Call
me back as soon as you can.&rdquo; He gave the
number, and hung up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father picked up the
conversation again, &ldquo;after managing to steal
certain blueprints during the week, the men
would naturally pick Saturday&mdash;their day off&mdash;to
schedule the pickups by the submarine.
We&rsquo;re still assuming, of course, that a submarine
actually is being used. It seems the
only logical means of getting in and out past
our alert Coast Guard. By timing the patrols,
they would know when to surface. They would
know how long to allow for their divers to row
into the bay, get the tube, and return to the
sub before the patrol doubled back. It&rsquo;s possible,
even, that the submarine carries a small
seaplane. After returning to unpatrolled
water, they could launch the seaplane to deliver
the cylinder to some surface vessel, or
possibly to an island or other land base. The
submarine itself probably stays around for
other pickups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are possibilities,&rdquo; Mr. Ross admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;I mention it,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father said, &ldquo;only
because, if it&rsquo;s true, the tubes which have been
picked up off the sand bar are already delivered.
In that case, your blueprints and my
radioisotope are no longer secrets. If not, however,
both still must be on the submarine. No
sub could shuttle back and forth to a foreign
shore fast enough to make delivery and get
back within a week&rsquo;s time. This is only a
guess, but they may lie a few miles offshore
during the week as a safety measure and to
conserve fuel. They come in and surface just
outside the bay each Saturday, under cover
of darkness. When they have everything
they&rsquo;re after, they&rsquo;ll head home. Since they
already have sufficient samples of the isotope,
my guess is that they are now after the final
blueprints. The small samples of the isotope
are now used only as tracers to help locate the
submerged cylinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teena&rsquo;s father seemed immensely impressed
by Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s reasoning. &ldquo;It so
happens,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the blueprints we discovered
missing today&mdash;added to the others&mdash;complete
the entire layout of our new secret
missile-guidance system. In the hands of an
unfriendly nation, there&rsquo;s no telling to what
improper use the guidance system might be
put.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; Mr. Jamison said, &ldquo;this must be
the end of their assignment&mdash;tonight&rsquo;s delivery
of the final blueprints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
how it would appear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Mr. Evans came back into the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been arranging a little surprise party,&rdquo; he said,
with a rather tense smile. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help but
overhear you, Mr. Taylor, while I was waiting
for one of my calls. I think you&rsquo;ve got that
submarine angle pretty well figured out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent a hitch in the Navy,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s
father said, smiling. &ldquo;Operating seagoing vessels&mdash;surface
or subsurface&mdash;falls into a general
pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Mr. Evans agreed, &ldquo;and I doubt
very much that any submarine refueling
tanker would be hanging around even several
hundred miles out. Like aircraft traffic, shipping
is run pretty well according to schedule.
A wandering tanker would simply invite
curiosity. But be that as it may, the immediate
task is to capture that submarine&mdash;if submarine
there is. We&rsquo;re still going on guesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want us to do?&rdquo; Mr. Taylor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be necessary for any of you to do
anything,&rdquo; the FBI man said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lined up
all the assistance needed. Everything is set.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to arrest those two men,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Eddie blurted out. &ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re
traitors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t go anyplace,&rdquo; Mr. Evans assured
him. &ldquo;The important thing right now
is that we don&rsquo;t tip off our plans. Possibly they
have various signals worked out with the submarine.
Things have to go right on schedule,
or we might lose the whole battle. Benton and
Simms are small fish and can be landed any
time we want. The big thing is the delivery
of those blueprints and the isotope. That&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve got to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone on Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s desk rang.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for you, Tom,&rdquo; he said, handing the instrument
to Teena&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;File clerk?&rdquo; Mr. Ross said, after listening
a few seconds. &ldquo;How about that! Thanks. No,
don&rsquo;t say a word to anyone.&rdquo; He hung up, and
turned to the FBI man. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s your
Roy Benton. A file clerk. New man. Been at
Acme just a little over a month. Can&rsquo;t figure,
though, how he managed to get into the secret
blueprint files. They&rsquo;re kept locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;Professional spies have ingenious ways of
working,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s pretty
plain now how both the radioisotope and the
blueprints happened to disappear. One thing&rsquo;s
equally certain. This is all part of a carefully
worked out plan. The job now is to stop that
plan&mdash;and stop it tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m frightened,&rdquo; Teena said. &ldquo;Spies,
and submarines, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Teena,&rdquo; Eddie said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
to be afraid of.&rdquo; Yet he had to clasp his own
hands tightly together to keep them from
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, everybody,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said,
looking at his watch, &ldquo;within an hour everything
will be set up. I&rsquo;m not free to reveal
our plan. However, since you are all involved
in this thing, I have no objection to your
witnessing the outcome. If an outcome there
is. Remember, we&rsquo;re going primarily on
guesses. So, if you want to drive quietly out
to the lighthouse, I&rsquo;ve arranged&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lighthouse!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed. &ldquo;We know
Captain Daniels. He&rsquo;s a good friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;I talked to him
on the phone. He&rsquo;s a Coast Guard man, you
know. And the Coast Guard is mighty important
to tonight&rsquo;s activity. You might find
what goes on out there, and in the bay, extremely
interesting to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can Teena and I go?&rdquo; Eddie asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said. &ldquo;Without you
two, we wouldn&rsquo;t have a thing to be working
on, would we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie flushed with pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the FBI man went on, &ldquo;you
will have to ask your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie looked pleadingly at his father.
Neither Mr. Taylor nor Mr. Ross voiced any
objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Mr. Evans said, rising, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no time to waste. I&rsquo;ll see you folks a little
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the office. The others sat for a moment
as though trying to catch their breaths
over the rapid developments of the past hours.
Mr. Jamison excused himself to report back
to Drake Ridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father said finally, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d
better call our wives and tell them we and the
children will be home late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfinished business,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Unfinished business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="34" /></div><h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
<p>Teena and Eddie, with their fathers, had
hamburgers and milk at a roadside stand. As
soon as it was dark, they drove toward the
lighthouse. They parked the car off the paved
four-lane highway which ran several hundred
yards back from the rocky point upon which
the lighthouse stood. The twisting, twin-rutted
road leading to the lighthouse was
much more suitable to a jeep than to a modern
low-slung car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>They had no more than climbed out of the
car, when a uniformed man stepped out of
the darkness in front of them. Eddie gasped
when he saw the rifle cradled in the stranger&rsquo;s
arms, poised ready for instant action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt and identify yourselves!&rdquo; a voice
challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Steve Taylor from Oceanview College,&rdquo;
Eddie&rsquo;s father spoke up quickly. &ldquo;With
me is Mr. Tom Ross. Also our two children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; the voice said, more pleasantly
now. &ldquo;Been expecting you. Go ahead,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wowee,&rdquo; Eddie whispered as they went
down the dark road. &ldquo;I wonder if there are
guards all around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Mr. Ross said. &ldquo;They certainly
set things up fast, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each time the lighthouse beacon swept
around in its circle, it cast a temporary glow
upon the road, making walking easy. When
they reached the base of the lighthouse, they
noticed several other shadowy forms moving
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you, mates?&rdquo; Old Captain Daniels
stepped out to meet them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Captain Daniels,&rdquo; Eddie greeted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s us, all right. Our fathers are with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Daniels shook hands with the two
men. &ldquo;Quite a party they&rsquo;re planning out here,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said, seeming to relish the excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;Although
we don&rsquo;t know just what they&rsquo;re
planning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, you will,&rdquo; said Captain Daniels.
&ldquo;But right now I&rsquo;ve got to check my light.
Darker&rsquo;n a ship&rsquo;s hold with a cargo of tar
paper tonight, it is. Won&rsquo;t be much to see&mdash;until
things start poppin&rsquo;. Might be a good
idea to sit there in front of my cottage and
watch down the coast. Just don&rsquo;t light any
matches, or make undue noise. If you spot
any strange lights, things may start happening.
I probably won&rsquo;t see you for a while. Can&rsquo;t
stop the light unless I&rsquo;m up top.&rdquo; He turned
and started up the spiraling stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the light?&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;I wonder
what Cap meant by that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;I suppose
you can stop those lights from turning in a
circle if you want to. Don&rsquo;t know why anyone
would want to, though. After all, the beam is
aimed rather high so it can be seen by ships
far off the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited over an hour. Except for the
gentle sound of waves lapping the shore below,
and a throbbing Coast Guard plane passing
by on its patrol, an eerie silence filled the
night. Looking seaward, there was nothing
to see but solid blackness. Three times each
minute the beacon from the lighthouse swept
a path of white through the sky. Since it was
aimed high, the beam didn&rsquo;t touch the water
in the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything is happening out there,&rdquo;
Eddie said, &ldquo;how are we going to know about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering that myself,&rdquo; his
father replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think they would spot some search-lights
along the beach or something,&rdquo; Mr.
Ross said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t very well do that, Tom,&rdquo;
Mr. Taylor said. &ldquo;They would risk tipping
off the whole trap. That Evans fellow impressed
me as knowing what to do. His is a
big responsibility, and there certainly wasn&rsquo;t
much time to weigh and measure things,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Teena said suddenly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a
light down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie&rsquo;s eyes followed the direction of her
outstretched arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is!&rdquo; he said, dropping his voice to
a tense whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s flashing on and off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light was only a pinpoint in the distance.
It flicked off and on in a pattern of dots
and dashes which Eddie guessed was some
kind of a code. The beam was directed seaward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eddie,&rdquo; Teena said, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that light about
where the old fisherman&rsquo;s shack is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Eddie said, trying to judge in
the darkness about how far down the coast
the shack was from the lighthouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;I figure you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; a voice spoke behind
them. All four turned. They couldn&rsquo;t
make out the stranger&rsquo;s face in the darkness,
but they could see that he was in Navy uniform.
As the lighthouse beacon swung around,
Eddie saw lieutenant&rsquo;s bars on his shoulders,
and the crossed-anchor insigne of the U.S.
Coast Guard on his cap. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll wait exactly
twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for what?&rdquo; Eddie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure,&rdquo; the officer said. &ldquo;But in
twenty minutes we spring the trap. Might
catch some big game, might catch nothing.
Please stay right where you are. Keep your
voices low. No lights of any kind.&rdquo; He turned
and went toward the lighthouse tower.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard officer had just left when
Teena grabbed Eddie&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she
whispered, pointing out across the dark bay.</p>
<p>Eddie sucked in his breath as a small light
far out on the water flashed three times
quickly, then stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s moving into the trap, all
right,&rdquo; his father whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>It was unbelievable to Eddie that twenty
minutes could be such a long time. No one
spoke. Nor were there any other flashes of
light to indicate any kind of activity going on.
Occasionally, Teena&rsquo;s father consulted the
luminous dial of his wrist watch. Eddie wondered
if he, too, found that twenty minutes
was an awfully long time.</p>
<p>Then, as the tension inside of Eddie
mounted to the point of bursting, the darkness
was shattered by a sudden rush of activity.</p>
<p>It began when the enormous beacon in the
lighthouse tower stopped rotating as the beam
pointed out across the bay. Then, amazingly,
the great finger of light was lowered until it
flooded the outer edge of the bay in a brilliant
blanket of white.</p>
<p>The sight revealed in the dazzling light
caused all four of them to jump to their feet.
In the deep water beyond the bay, and approximately
half a mile offshore, the deck and
superstructure of a submarine stood out
plainly on the surface of the calm water. Even
at that distance, Eddie could make out the
frantic scramble of men pinned in the blinding
grip of light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/i06.jpg" alt="... he saw the small rubber boat moving in." width="500" height="623" />
<p class="caption">... <i>he saw the small rubber boat moving in</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Then he saw the small rubber boat moving
in toward the sand bar of the bay. Three
figures were plainly visible in it. Two had
been paddling. But the paddles were now
frozen in the light. The third figure was
dressed in what looked like a skin-diving outfit.
The light reflected on the glass face plate
pushed up onto his forehead. Suddenly the
two men with the paddles swung about and
started pulling frantically back toward the
submarine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sub will try to dive!&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s father
said quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the men in the rubber boat?&rdquo; Teena
said. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be left behind,&rdquo; Mr. Ross said
tensely.</p>
<p>But whatever method of escape was intended,
it was quickly blocked. Out of the
night came the throbbing roar of aircraft.
Then two dark shapes circled into the glow of
light from the lighthouse beacon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coast Guard planes!&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Adding to the brilliance, the Coast Guard
aircraft dropped magnesium flares directly
over the surfaced submarine, then continued
their circling.</p>
<p>A new pulsating sound was added to the
night scene as two helicopters swept past the
lighthouse and slanted directly toward the
submarine. Each helicopter carried two large
barrellike objects under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depth charges,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father said. &ldquo;If
that submarine tries to dive it&rsquo;s a goner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently the commander of the submarine
realized the futility of escape. A white
flag caught the light, as someone on deck began
waving it wildly.</p>
<p>More flares blossomed out as the aircraft
circled around for the second time. Suddenly
two Coast Guard patrol boats nosed into the
lighted area. One of them fired a warning shot
over the bow of the undersea craft. The white
flag began to wave more urgently than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The action had taken less than five minutes.
Eddie&rsquo;s mind whirled with excitement. And
then, almost as suddenly as it had started, it
was over. One of the Coast Guard boats swept
into the bay and picked up the men in the
rubber raft. The larger boat swerved in and
lay alongside the submarine. Eddie could see
the crew of the submarine being transferred
to the launch. A few remained, while several
armed Coast Guardsmen boarded the submarine.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the patrolling aircraft
buzzed low over the scene for the last
time, then disappeared into the darkness, returning
to their base. The helicopters swung
back inland. The unused depth charges were
still racked securely beneath them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, that was some timing,&rdquo; Eddie&rsquo;s
father said, as the chop-chop-chop of the helicopters
faded into the distance. The submarine
had started to move up the coast in
the direction of the U.S. Coast Guard depot.</p>
<p>The flares sputtered out, and all was quiet
once more on the water. Suddenly the beam
from the lighthouse slanted up to its normal
position, then began to revolve slowly in its
familiar fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, folks,&rdquo; the Coast Guard lieutenant
said, coming up behind them, &ldquo;show&rsquo;s over for
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a real show it was,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father
said admiringly. &ldquo;That was some display of
teamwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All part of our training,&rdquo; the officer said,
obviously pleased the way things had turned
out. &ldquo;We keep the wheels greased. When they
have to turn, they turn smoothly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight&rsquo;s proof positive of that,&rdquo; Mr.
Taylor complimented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My instructions,&rdquo; the young officer said,
&ldquo;are to escort you to the Coast Guard depot.
Those taken into custody should be there by
the time we arrive. You may have a few questions
to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teena and Eddie rode with the lieutenant
in the gray sedan with &ldquo;U.S. Coast Guard&rdquo;
printed on its doors. Their fathers followed
in Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s car. Gates opened as they
entered the Coast Guard depot a while later.
They were escorted into a large briefing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>Within two hours the investigation was
complete enough to draw some firm conclusions.
Mr. Evans, of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and a Captain Foster, of the U.S.
Coast Guard, stood before the group. There
were many strange faces in the room. Some of
the men were in uniform; some were not.
Eddie supposed most of them were government
or police officials of some kind.</p>
<p>Under close guard over to one side of the
room were two dozen or more men. They
were all strangers. Their uniforms, although
of a seaman&rsquo;s variety, were completely unfamiliar
to Eddie.</p>
<p>There were also several men in civilian
clothing being held under guard. Among
them Eddie saw the two unlucky fishermen
he had come to know as Harvey Simms and
Roy Benton. They scowled darkly at him.
Eddie scowled back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>Mr. Evans seemed to have caught the exchange
of glances. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he said to
Eddie, &ldquo;I mentioned that we should have no
trouble grabbing them whenever we wanted
to. Well, we got them. A few others, too.
Simms and Benton were sitting outside that
old fisherman&rsquo;s shack, still holding the battery
lantern they used to signal the submarine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, oh, boy!&rdquo; Eddie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; Mr. Evans went on,
turning to the main group, &ldquo;please regard
all that is said here as confidential until it is
officially released through the proper channels.
If you are wondering why these two
young people are sitting in on this hush-hush
session, I take great pride and pleasure in informing
you that, without their alertness and
curiosity over certain suspicious actions, that
submarine might now be on its way seaward
carrying two secrets very precious to this
country&rsquo;s security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eddie blushed but felt mighty good. Teena
looked at her hands, trying to hide the pleased
smile on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Taylor and Mr. Ross,&rdquo; the FBI man
said, &ldquo;this should also please you. We found
two more of those sealed metal cylinders inside
the submarine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then they hadn&rsquo;t delivered them!&rdquo;
Eddie&rsquo;s father said with obvious relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. In fact, the submarine commander
has admitted that they have been lying
about thirty miles off the coast during the
week. Tonight was their third trip to the bay.
Incidentally, it was scheduled to be their last.
They had plenty of the secret radioisotope,
and today&rsquo;s blueprint delivery completed the
main set on the new missile-guidance system
they also were after. If we hadn&rsquo;t set the trap
tonight, we would have been too late&mdash;another
reason for appreciating the alertness on the
parts of your son, Eddie, and Mr. Ross&rsquo;s
daughter, Teena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Mr. Evans continued, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t
had time to solve who was behind all of this,
or why. We have our ideas, of course, but it&rsquo;s
going to take considerable investigation to
draw a full and clear picture. At the moment,
I&rsquo;m not free to reveal to what country that submarine
belongs. I did think, though, that you
two gentlemen deserved to know that the
isotope and the blueprints are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a long time, I imagine, before
either Mr. Ross or I will hear better news,&rdquo;
Eddie&rsquo;s father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order not to delay nuclear research, nor
to hold up production at Acme Aircraft,&rdquo; the
FBI man said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re sending the tubes with
you under armed guard to your laboratory,
and you can take over from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure,&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I believe, gentlemen,&rdquo; Mr. Evans
went on, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s probably your main interest
at the moment. The rest of it you will doubtless
read about in your newspapers within a
day or two. I imagine the lights and commotion
out around the bay a while ago attracted
plenty of attention. Even with the naked eye,
it would be simple to identify a submarine
lying on the surface. Newsmen are crowding
the gates outside right now. They&rsquo;ll get their
story as soon as we&rsquo;ve filled in a few gaps and
get a release from Washington. All I ask is that
you do no talking about it until it has been
cleared for the press. All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; Eddie promised
fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; Teena backed him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Mr. Ross said, rising, &ldquo;I guess
you won&rsquo;t need us any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you if there&rsquo;s anything else,&rdquo;
Mr. Evans said by way of dismissing them.
&ldquo;Before you go, though, I do want to thank
you all for your fine co-operation. Particularly
you two young people.&rdquo; He smiled again at
Teena and Eddie. &ldquo;This may sound awfully
big&mdash;and it is&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve both done a great
service for your country. As long as we have
alert young Americans like you two, this country&rsquo;s
future is in good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A burst of applause went up. It seemed a
strange place for it, there in the briefing room.
Eddie found it almost impossible to conceal
the pride that puffed up inside of him. Teena
was grinning, too, as they got up to follow
their fathers outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>Both of them took a last look around the
room. They saw the group of sullen men in
strange uniforms. They saw the tall man and
the fat man, whose clumsy efforts at being
fishermen had first aroused their suspicions.
They saw the pleased looks on the faces of the
FBI agent, the Coast Guardsmen, and the
others in the &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; side of the room. They
saw their fathers walking toward the door,
carefully carrying the all-important metal
tubes.</p>
<p>Neither Teena nor Eddie could find anything
to say. Then they were outside. The
stars blinked overhead. Every few seconds the
circling beacon from the distant lighthouse
swept its white finger across the sky. The cool
breeze from the nearby ocean gave added zest
to their high spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful how everything worked
out, Eddie?&rdquo; Teena said finally. &ldquo;And to think
that we were some help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; Eddie said. &ldquo;It all worked out great,
didn&rsquo;t it? Really great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking proudly, they followed their
fathers toward the parking lot.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
